Need ruby program to output html file from glossary.xml. glossary.xml has example tags too.
Update the other ruby programs so they use xml parser.

Text files are deprecated. We won't use them any longer unless there are compelling reasons.
done units.txt, units.dtd and units.rb
done models.txt, models.dtd and models.rb

create glossary.dtd, glossary.txt and glossary.rb - not urgent as glossary is already in ios5 version.
create reviewit.dtd, reviewit.txt and reviewit.rb
create takeit.dtd, takeit.txt and takeit.rb not urgent as it is small and can be done manually
done converting from units.xml to ios5 version via section.rb and menu.rb in XMLtoHTML
