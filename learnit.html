    <img src="models/gravity.jpg" alt="gravity" align="middle"/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Ernst Ravenstein developed the <strong>Gravity Model</strong>.
      The Gravity Model predicts the interaction between two places based on the size of their populations and the
      distance between them. This model assumes that spatial interaction is directly linked to the populations and
      indirectly linked to the distance between the two places. There is a math equation that goes with the Gravity
      Model: multiple the two populations together and then divide by the distance between them. This equations shows
      how often they interact with each other.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Distance decay</strong> is the idea that the farther two
      groups of people are away from each other, the communication between them decreases. Distance decay is commonly
      shown on a graph. One axis is labeled amount of interaction intensity, and the other axis is labeled increasing
      distance. At the top of the graph is &quot;very high interaction.&quot; This means the distance between the two
      groups is small. Under &quot;very high interaction&quot; is &quot;high interaction.&quot; The distance line shows
      the distance between the two groups is a little bigger. As you go down the graph, there becomes less interaction
      and a larger distance between the two groups.</p>

    <img src="models/epidemiological.jpg" alt="epidemiological" align="middle"/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>Epidemiological Transition Model</strong> shows the
      cause of death in each of the stages in the Demographic Transition Model. The first stage was developed by Abdel
      Omran in 1971. It has been modified to 4 main stages and a possible fifth stage. The Black Plaque was the major
      cause of death in Stage 1. It killed 25 million Europeans from 1347 to 1350, and the Black Plaque killed 13
      million Chinese in 1380. Cholera, an infection in the small intestine, was a major epidemic in the time of the
      Industrial Revolution. This was the major epidemic in Stage 2. It killed a half of million people in New York City
      in 1832, and it wiped out ? of Cairo in 1831. In Stage 3, the major cause of death was infectious diseases and
      chronic disorders associated with aging, such as cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Infectious diseases have
      started to decline sharply in Stage 3 countries. Stage 4 is characterized by cardiovascular diseases and cancer.
      Medical advances have extended the life expectancy of older people. The growth of cancer can now be slowed down or
      removed all together. There is a possible Stage 5 that is characterized by infectious diseases and parasitic
      diseases.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Population pyramids</strong> show the age distribution and
      sex ratio of a specific population. They present the percentage of each age group in the entire population. Each
      age group is called a cohort. By looking at a country&apos;s population pyramid, you can tell how wealthy a
      country is and what stage of the DTM it is in. The key is to look at birth and death rates. In poorer countries,
      the birth and death rates are usually high. If there is a large amount of children and a small amount of elderly
      people, the country is usually less developed. In a wealthier country, the birth and death rates are low. If there
      is an almost equal percentage of children and elderly people, the country is usually more developed.</p>

    <img src="models/corePeriphery.jpg" alt="core periphery" align="middle"/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> The world economy is a three-tier structure: the core, the
      periphery, and semi-periphery. Core processes incorporate higher levels of education and include higher wages and
      more technology. There processes develop more wealth in the global economy. On the contrary, periphery processes
      include the lower levels of education and incorporate lower salaries and less technology. Semi-peripheries, as you
      can imagine, are simply a buffer between the two extremes of core and periphery. This process generally includes
      the exploitation of the periphery by the core. Although these are processes, they occur in places and are
      sometimes assigned to states. For example, the US and Canada are core states while Chile and Iraq are
      periphery.</p>

    <img src="models/demographicTransition.jpg" alt="demographic transition" align="middle"/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>Demographic Transition Model</strong> (DTM) was
      developed in 1929 by Warren Thompson. It has four main stages. Stage 1 is low growth, Stage 2 is high growth,
      Stage 3 is moderate growth, and Stage 4 is low growth. In Stage 1, the crude birth rates (CBR) and the crude death
      rates (CDR) are equally high. The Bubonic Plaque marks Stage 1 because of its high CDR. There are no countries
      currently in Stage 1. In Stage 2, the CBR is high, but the CDR is declining. During the late 1700s-early 1800s,
      the world population increased greatly. This was also the time of the Industrial Revolution. In Stage 3, the CDR
      still decline but much slower. The CBR sharply starts to decline. Most countries in Europe and North America enter
      Stage 3 in the early 1900s. The world&apos;s population still grew, but it grew at a much slower rate. In Stage 4,
      both the CBR and the CDR are low. Stage 4 also signifies women becoming more educated and entering the work force.
      Depending on the version of the DTM you look at, there may or may not be a fifth stage. Though not an official
      stage, it is still possible. In Stage 5, the CBR and the CDR are equally low. This signifies zero growth.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Rostow&apos;s Model of Development</h1><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Walt Rostow&apos;s Ladder of Development model, also called the
      modernization model, shows the steps of development in countries. His model has to assume that all countries
      develop the same. There are five stages of development in this model. The first stage is called traditional. The
      main activity in countries at this stage is subsistence farming. These countries have a rigid social structure.
      The people of the country often refuse technological change. The second stage is called preconditions of takeoff.
      In this stage, there is a new leadership that moves the country towards diversity and flexibility. It prepares the
      country for the next stage. The third stage is called takeoff. During this stage, the country goes through
      something similar to an industrial revolution. Urbanization and industrialization start to occur. Improvements in
      technology and productions start to happen. The economy then enters the fourth stage called drive to maturity.
      During this stage, modernization starts to spark in important parts of the country. New technologies begin to
      diffuse, and industrial specialization starts up throughout the nation. Also, the population growth rate starts to
      slow. Only some countries reach the fifth stage. This stage is characterized by higher worker incomes and a
      widespread production of goods and services. The service industry develops greatly. Much of the country&apos;s
      workforce will be concentrated in the service sector. Rostow&apos;s model has received criticisms just like other
      development models. The problem with his model is it doesn&apos;t provide any context to development.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In 1967, August L&ouml;sch wanted to determine the where the best
      sites for building manufacturing plants were in order to maximize profit. He added the influence of consumer
      demands and production costs to his calculations. Businesses usually locate themselves in an area where the can
      make a profit. This is how L&ouml;sch&apos;s model works. He said the ideal place for a manufacturing plant would
      be in an area where production and transportation costs were low and income is high.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Hotelling&apos;s Model</h1><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Harold Hotelling created the locational interdependence model. It
      states that two business competitors will try to take away from each other&apos;s territories in order to maximize
      sales. This would eventually result in the two businesses selling their products across from each other. To
      explain this, Hotelling used two ice cream vendors selling ice cream on a beach. They both start by selling at
      opposite ends of the beach. After a while, both vendors try to maximize their sales by moving closer to the
      customers at the middle of the beach. Eventually, these vendors end up selling across from each other. The whole
      point of Hotelling&apos;s analysis was to show that the location of a business cannot be fully understood until it
      is referenced with the location of other businesses just like it.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Weber&apos;s Model</h1><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Alfred Weber, a German economic geographer, developed a model for
      the ideal location of a business. His model was called the <strong>Least Cost Theory</strong>. The Least Cost
      Theory finds the ideal location of a business by using three categories of costs that would minimize costs. These
      categories are transportation, labor, and agglomeration. The first category is transportation. The location had to
      result in the lowest possible cost of shipping raw materials to the manufacturing plant and the finished goods to
      the market. The second category is labor. Putting a business in an area where labor is cheap is ideal. If the
      business is put far from the resource location, the low cost of labor would make up for the transportation costs.
      The third category is agglomeration. Agglomeration is when many businesses are clustered in one area. This saves
      money because the equipment and furniture one company needs can be made by another company in the same area. The
      costs of transportation is greatly cut down.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Central Place Theory</h1><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>central place theory</strong> was created by <strong>Walter
      Christaller</strong>. This model predicts how and where central places in the urban hierarchy (cities to villages)
      would be distributed based on their function and placement. The model is based on a few assumptions. The first is
      that the surface of the ideal region would be flat with no physical barriers, such as mountains or rivers.
      Secondly, that the soil fertility would be universal, so agriculture could take place anywhere in the city. Third,
      population and purchasing power would be evenly distributed. Next, transportation would be uniform and be
      available from one region to the next. Finally, any good or service could be sold anywhere and in every direction
      out to a certain distance. The model is set up so the largest central place would provide the most functions to
      the majority of the region. His model isn&apos;t circular, but actually a collection of hexagons that fit
      perfectly together. You can see an example of Christaller&apos;s model in the <strong>Sunbelt phenomenon</strong>
      in southern regions.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The architecture of homes vary as they are scattered across
      different locations in different environments. For example, most New England Homes have the chimney in the center
      as to warm the house as a whole. The Middle Atlantic has a warmer climate, therefore the chimney is at only one
      end of the house. Southern houses are raised off the ground to cool the interior.

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The sector model was created by Homer Hoyt in the late 1930s. It
      serves as an evolved model from the concentric zone model, surpassing the limits of Burgess&apos;s. This model
      focuses on residential patterns to explain where the wealthy in a city choose to live. Hoyt developed this model
      like pie, with each slice representing a different residential area, education and recreation, transportation, and
      industrial sectors. The focal point of the city is the core, where the other sectors grow outward. </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> The world economy is a three-tier structure: the core, the
      periphery, and semi-periphery. Core processes incorporate higher levels of education and include higher wages and
      more technology. There processes develop more wealth in the global economy. On the contrary, periphery processes
      include the lower levels of education and incorporate lower salaries and less technology. Semi-peripheries, as you
      can imagine, are simply a buffer between the two extremes of core and periphery. This process generally includes
      the exploitation of the periphery by the core. Although these are processes, they occur in places and are
      sometimes assigned to states. For example, the US and Canada are core states while Chile and Iraq are
      periphery.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Human territoriality is a term generally referring to the opinion
      of Robert Sack who describes human territoriality as "the attempt by an individual or group to affect, influence,
      or control people, phenomena, and relationships, by delimiting and asserting control over a [specific] geographic
      area (De Blij et. al., 2007, p.222)." There are several ways for a group to control another, including physical
      force or organized sets of laws. His view contrasts with that of Robert Audrey, who believes that human
      territoriality is similar to the general behavior of animals. By contrast, Sack believes that human territoriality
      is shown in many arrangements based on the settings (as the territorial strategy changes) and should not be
      compared to mere animal instinct. Human behavior is learned unlike animals where behavior is instinctive. Central
      to the idea of state is the concept of territoriality, making states such as the USA or Portugal examples of a
      territoriality. The concept of territoriality today is tied closely with the concept of sovereignty; In specific
      terms, a territoriality is defined by a country or community's strong defense and protection over its territory as
      a result of its sense of attachment to it.

    <h1 style="color:white"> Human Geography</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Human geography is all about how the people and the land connect
      together into one world. The different areas of the world all bring their own uniqueness to the table. With
      different resources, landscapes, and culture the individual regions create a sense of originality. Human Geography
      is also the study the people&apos;s and resources&apos; spatial organization. These places are very dynamic with
      changing land features and political boundaries. These changes may be caused by the residents or the environment.
      A region&apos;s values, attitudes, and behaviors may rub off on other regions. These changes on the other cultures
      could be positive or negative. Places can also exhibit a symbolic presence. An example of this would be how the
      Statue of Liberty on Ellis Island represents liberty. All of the locations are dependent on one another, creating
      interdependence. An example of interdependence is how we trade with many countries for their resources. We depend
      on the Middle East for their oil. (De Blij, Fouberg, Murphy,8)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> There are many different cultures with many different belief
      systems and values. These belief systems can identify a group of people. There are many examples of these belief
      systems. One is ethnocentrism which is the belief that all other cultures are inferior to your own. Imperialism is
      when a country extends their political or economic power over another culture or region. This may be direct
      through colonialism or indirect through trade. A culture that believes in masculinism believes that males are the
      predominant sex. Environmental determinism is the belief that the land affects the human activity in the area.

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Regional Geography focuses on boundaries or analytical

      Systematic Geography is the study of topics. These topics may be population, religion, language, and economic
      development. (Knox, Marston, 4)</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Spatial Analysis</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">There are many ways to identify a place or location. Nominal
      location is when we indicate a place by giving it a name. Absolute location is referring to a place with degrees
      in latitude and longitude. Relative location is directions in reference to other locations. A site is physical
      descriptions of the location such as soil, vegetation, usage,etc. Situation is similar to relative location.</p>
    <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">There are corresponding ways to get to the location. Absolute
      distance is measured in miles or kilometers. Relative direction is measured in time or amount of money it takes to
      get there. Distance may be a mental perception, or an opinion of how far a place may be. Friction of distance is
      the fact that if a location is too far away, many people will not travel there due to the lack of ease or money
      needed. Distance-delay function is the idea that the farther away from a central point, the decrease of activity
      becomes more apparent. Topological Space is the connections between specific points. Accessibility is the measure
      of ease to get from one point to another. (De Blij, Fouberg, Murphy, 10)</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">The Five Themes</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The first theme is location The point of place creates a reaction
      and a reason to why that reaction happened.Location is practically the underlying concept of all Human Geography
      because of this.Geographers can use location to predict events or understand why past event occurred. This is
      called Location Theory.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The next is Human-Environment Interactions. The environment affect
      human actions through resource location, dangers, and pleasing climates. People affect the environment through
      pollution, altering ecosystems, and damaging resources.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The third theme is regions. Geographic phenomenas are not
      dispersed across Earth evenly. Regions may be may be agglomerated into different areas which are termed
      regions.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The next theme is place. A sense of place is remembering events
      and connecting memories with emotions about a place. A perception of a place is a feeling towards a location based
      on media.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The last theme is movement which can be described as the mobility
      of humans, products, and concepts. Spatial interaction depends on accessibility. (et al, 11)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Cartography is the creation of maps. Reference maps show locations

      product.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Absolute location is the precise coordinates of a place using
      longitude and latitude. The relative location marks a place in relation to its surroundings. Mental maps are a
      remembrance of a place we have never been through what we have studied. Even if you have never been to the west
      coast of the United States, you would most likely be able to recognize the states&apos; formation on a map.
      Activity spaces are the area in which you would normally spend your time. This allows you to be comfortable in
      your surroundings by know where everything is. (et al, 14)</p>

      natural disasters. You may have seen remote sensing at work when you saw the eye of a hurricane on the news.
      Geographic information systems (GIS) is basically a layered map of all different types of information using
      digital technology. (et al,17)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Culture is the similar beliefs and values of a group of people.
      These values or other interests are considered cultural traits. The combination of many cultural traits is called
      a culture complex. A cultural hearth is where these culture traits originated. (et al, 26)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Culture diffusion is the spread of a culture trait from its
      hearth. Distance and time may inhibit or decrease diffusion. This is termed distance decay. Cultural barriers may
      totally inhibit the culture traits because of their own belief systems. Expansion diffusion is when the idea or
      product stays popular in the hearth while diffusing outward. Contagious diffusion is when almost all of the
      adjacent communities are using the product or idea. Hierarchical diffusion is when the trait is first passed to
      influential people or places. It then follows the places in the direction of rank. Stimulus diffusion is when the
      trait is directly introduced to the new community. Relocation diffusion is the movement of the people who have
      this trait and directly transport it to a new location. (et al, 28)</p>

      world&apos;s population lives in China and India. China and India have large areas of land where no one lives.
      This means they have high population densities in larger cities. One-fourth of the world&apos;s population is
      located in eastern Asia alone. Southern Asia holds the second biggest amount of people in the world. Many people
      believe countries under count the minority populations. This leads to less representation in the government so a

    <h1 style="color:white"> The Rise or Fall of Populations in Certain Places</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Paul Ehrlich published <em>The Population Bomb</em> in the late
      1960s. This publication raised awareness about how the many countries&apos; populations were increasing too
      rapidly. This rapid increase in the these countries&apos; populations were outpacing food production. Ehrlich&apos;s
      idea is much like Thomas Malthus&apos;s idea. Malthus believed the world&apos;s population was outpacing food
      production, but he believed that the food that fed a country was only grown in that country. His idea was flawed,
      but Ehrlich took his idea and revised it to the national level instead of the world level. Every population has a
      doubling time, or the time it takes to double that population. Every growth rate for a population has a doubling
      time. The world&apos;s doubling time has dropped from 1,600 years to 51 years in the past 2,000 years (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.44-45).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white"> Population Changes</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Population changes are most commonly measured by the crude birth
      rate the crude death rate, and the rate of natural increase. The <strong>crude birth rate</strong>, or CBR, is
      total number of lives births annually per 1,000 people in the area being looked at. For example, if a country&apos;s
      CBR is 35, this means that for every 1,000 people in the country, there are 35 babies born over a one-year period
      in that country. The <strong>crude death rate</strong>, or CDR, is the total number of deaths in a one-year period
      per 1,000 people in the area being looked at. The CDR of a country is expressed in the same way as the
      countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s CBR. If a country&apos;s CDR is 15, it is expressed as 15 deaths a year per 1,000 people living
      in that country. The word <em>crude</em> is used because these rates are calculated in a society, not certain
      individuals or groups. The <strong>rate of natural increase</strong>, or RNI, is the percentage of population
      growth in a year. It is found by subtracting the CDR from the CBR. For example, if the CBR is 35 births per 1,000
      people and the CDR is 15 deaths per 1,000 people, then the RNI is 20 per 1,000, or 2.0%. The RNI excludes
      migration (Rubenstein, 2005, pg. 53).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Currently, the worldÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s RNI is 1.3. This means that every
      year, the world&apos;s population is growing 1.3%. This rate is not nearly as high as it was in 1963 at 2.2%, the
      all-time high record. The RNI has dropped sharply in the past few decades. The world population is growing by 80
      million people annually. The annual increase has dropped at a much slower rate than the RNI because the population
      base is much higher than it was in the past. For example, the world&apos;s population increased from 4 billion to
      5 billion people in just 13 years, and the world&apos;s population increased from 5 billion to 6 billion in just
      12 years. The population base continues to grow so much that a one-tenth of 1% change could dramatically change
      the world&apos;s population growth. The difference between a 1% and 2% change is huge because of the high
      population base. The difference between a RNI of 1.0% and a RNI of 1.3% is 15 million more people are added to the
      world&apos;s population with a RNI of 1.3% than a RNI of 1.0% (Rubenstein, 2005, pgs. 53-57).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Another way to calculate the total number of births in a society
      is the <strong>total fertility rate</strong>, or TFR. TFR is the average number of children a will give birth to
      during her childbearing years (generally 15 to 50). The TFR is more of a prediction of how many children will be
      born per woman in the future. The TFR is calculated by assuming that women in the future will have the same number
      of babies that women in the present will have. Currently, the global TFR is about 3. The TFR is generally higher
      in less developed countries and lower in more developed countries. Beside CDR, to other forms of mortality
      measurements are <strong>infant mortality rate</strong>, or IMR, and life expectancy. IMR is the number of deaths
      annually of children under the age of one. It is expressed as the number of deaths per 1,000 births. The higher
      IMRs are in poorer countries, such as sub-Saharan African countries. The lower IMRs are found in Europe and other
      more developed countries. IMR usually mirror the countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s health care system. Countries with more
      well-trained doctors and nurses and more modern hospitals and medicines have lower IMR than countries with less
      well-trained doctors and nurses and less modern hospitals and medicines. <strong>Life expectancy</strong> is
      another form of mortality measurement. Life expectancy is the total number of years an individual is expected to
      live in the current conditions in which they live in. The life expectancy is higher in wealthier countries and
      lower in poorer countries (Rubenstein, 2005, pgs. 55-57).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white"> Population Policies</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Population policies can also affect population growth. Population
      policies are policies put in place by a country&apos;s government to help influence the country&apos;s overall
      growth rate. There are three types of population policies: expansive, eugenic, and restricted. Expansive policies
      encourage families to have many children. Also, the rate of natural increase increases. Some governments pay
      families to have more children. Many European countries have put these policies in place because of their aging
      populations. Eugenic policies favor one ethnic or racial group. These policies can discriminate secretly by making
      the unfavored groups pay taxes. Nazi Germany is an example of this type of population policy. Restrictive
      population policies encourage families to have small families. These policies decrease the rate of natural
      increase. An example of a restrictive population policy is China&apos;s &quot;One Child Policy&quot; (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 63-64).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Migration</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> There are three basic types of movement: cyclic movement,
      periodic movement, and migration. <strong>Cyclic movement</strong> is a journey that begins in one place and ends
      in that same place. Cyclic movement can be described as a daily routine. The space a person needs to function in
      during cyclic movement is called <strong>activity space</strong>. Commuting is a form of cyclic movement.
      Commuting is described as the journey from home to work and then back to home again. This can include many
      different forms of transportation, such as by bus, by train, and by car. Seasonal movement is another form of
      cyclic movement. An example of seasonal movement is living in the US for the winter and then returning to the
      Canada to live for the rest of the year. Nomadism is another form of cyclic movement. Although not very common, it
      still exists in parts of Africa and Asia. Nomadism is when nomads travel a long, familiar path over and over
      again. These nomads become familiar with the water and food sources along the path they travel (de Blij, Murphy, &
      Fouberg, 2007, pgs.71-72).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Periodic movement</strong> is a like cyclic movement; it
      is a journey away from home. The difference is periodic movement is a long period away from home while cyclic
      movement is a short journey away from home. A common form of periodic movement is migrant labor. Millions of
      workers temporarily move to places where cheap labor is needed. <strong>Transhumance</strong> is a system pastoral
      farming in which farmers move their livestock to different pastures depending on the season. It is considered a
      periodic movement because it involves a long time away from home for the farmer. Going away to college can be
      categorized as periodic movement. Even though you are keeping the same home address, most of your time is spent at
      the college. Military service is another form of periodic movement. It involves being temporarily relocated to a
      new place that can last several years (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, p.72).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Migration</strong> is defined as being moving permanently
      to a new location across large distances. International migration is the movement between country borders. When a
      migrant leaves the country they live in, they are called an emigrant, and they are called an immigrant when they
      enter a new country to live. Immigration adds to the population of a country, and emigration subtracts from the
      population of a country. <strong>Internal migration</strong> is migration that takes place inside a
      countryÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s borders. Internal migration varies due to the mobility of that country&apos;s population. Longer
      distances are more common in countries with a mobile population. In the US, internal migrants are more likely to
      move from one economic region to another. Because of this, there has been an increase in internal migration in the
      past few decades to the Sunbelt and Far West regions. In country&apos;s with a less mobile population, common
      internal migration is moving from the rural areas to the capital city of that country. Reasons for internal
      migration are economic opportunities, retirement, and the want for different lifestyles (de Blij, Murphy, &
      Fouberg, 2007, pgs.72-73).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Why People Migrate</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Forced migration</strong> deals with a position of
      authority. This authority makes people move without giving them a choice, also known as involuntary migration. a
      good example of forced migration is the Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade. Africans were taken from their homes and sent
      to the Americas and the Caribbean to be sold as slaves. Many of the Africans did not survive the boat ride from
      Africa. This was the largest practice of forced migration in history. The number of African sold into slavery is
      not known, but the estimates are anywhere from 12 million to 30 million. Africans were first sent to the Caribbean
      during the 16th century. Despite popular belief, most of the Africans were not sent to North America. The majority
      of them were sent to the Caribbean and South America (mainly Brazil). Forced migration still exists today in the
      form of countermigration. For example, in the 1990s, the US sent Haitian immigrants that arrived in Florida back
      to Haiti (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.74-76).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Voluntary migration</strong> is migration in which the
      immigrants have a choice on if they want to move and to where they want to move. Push and Pull factors coincide
      with voluntary migration. <strong>Push factors</strong> are conditions that &quot;push&quot; people away from the
      place they are currently living. <strong>Pull factors</strong> are factors that attracts migrants to a certain
      location. Distance decay comes into the picture when talking about pull factors. <strong>Distance decay</strong>
      is the idea that the farther an individual or group away from another individual or group, the communication
      between them decreases. This idea can help people decide where they want to move to because they may not want to
      lose communication with another group by migrating far away. <strong>Step migration</strong> is moving to a
      certain destination in stages. An example of this could be moving a peasant living in the rural area of Brazil.
      His goal is to migrate to the capital city of Brasilia. First, he will most likely move to a small village, then
      to a town nearby. From the town, he will most likely move to a city, and then finally, he will move to Brasilia.
      However, not all migrants who set out for a large city will make it there. They may encounter employment along the
      way to the large city, or <strong>intervening opportunity</strong> (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.74,
      76-77).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">There are different types of push and pull factors: economic
      conditions, political circumstances, armed conflict and civil war, environmental conditions, culture and
      traditions, and technological advances (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 77-79).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Economic Conditions- Many people face poverty in their home
      country. In search of a better life, many immigrants, both illegal and legal, cross country borders to look for
      new opportunities to find work (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 77).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Political Circumstances- Many immigrants migrate because of the
      way the government works in their country. Also, a certain government system may attract immigrants to a country
      (de Blij,Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 77).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Armed Conflict and Civil War- Many people cannot stay safe in
      their country during a war. This causes people to migrate to safer regions (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      77).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Environmental Conditions- Environmental conditions can mean
      anything from natural disasters to famines to pollution. This causes migration to another location that could
      support the group of people (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 77-78).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Culture and Traditions- The culture and traditions of a certain
      group of people differ from group to group. When a new political change takes over the government, they might not
      agree with the culture and traditions of a certain group. This may cause the group to leave the country and
      practice their culture and traditions somewhere else (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 78-79).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Technological Advances- Different areas of the world are more
      technologically advanced than other areas. In those areas, communication and transportation systems are more
      modern and easier to use. This attracts new immigrants to these areas (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      79).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> For the past 5 centuries, people have traveled the globe for
      reasons other than exploration, fame, and spices; these travelers are migrating. The majority of global migration
      patterns are Europeans migrating to the Americas, the Caribbean, parts of Asia, Africa, and Australia. Other
      global migration flows include Indians to Africa, Africans to the Americas, and China to the Americas and the rest
      of Southeast Asia (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 79-81).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Guest workers</strong> are labor migrants that came from
      other European countries to replace the workers in Western European countries that died in World War II. Guest
      workers were legal immigrants that held work visas.These migrants were not forced to come to these countries; they
      wanted to come work. This gave them an opportunity to find work and earn money for their families&apos;. The
      majority of guest workers worked as agricultural laborers or in the service industry, such as hotels, restaurants,
      and tourist attractions (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 86).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>refugee</strong> is a person who flees their homeland
      because of fear of persecution. In 2000, the United Nations put the refugee count at over 24 million. There are
      two types of refugees: internal refugees and international refugees. Internal refugees, also known as displaced
      persons, are refugees that do not cross an international border. These people are usually under counted, if they
      are even counted. An international refugee, on the other hand, is a refugee that has crossed one or more
      international borders. Usually, they find a refugee camp that is not in their own country. One of the largest
      areas for refugees is Sub-Saharan Africa. Many incidents, such as the collapse of the country Zaire and the
      violent outbreak between the Tutsi and Hutu groups in Rwanda. Also, Sudan significantly contributes to the refugee
      problem in Sub-Saharan Africa. Sudan has been in a civil war for about 20 years. The government began the genocide
      in Darfur. Many people in Darfur are refugees because they will be killed if they don&apos;t move away from their
      homes (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 86-90).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Since the September 11 attacks in 2001, the United StateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s
      immigration policies have become more strict on security. A big concern in the US is illegal immigration. The
      Justice Department allows for illegal immigrants to be detained even if they have no ties to terrorist
      organizations. This policy is in place because of the idea that terrorists will travel to a country, such as
      Mexico or Haiti, to illegally immigrate to the US to commit terrorist acts (Rubenstein, 2005, pgs. 94-95).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white"> Unit 3- Culture </h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A culture may be defined as a group of people who share similar
      values and practices. These people may be acknowledged by themselves or by outsiders who recognize their
      uniqueness. There are two main types of cultures: folk culture and popular culture. Folk culture is focused on a
      small, homogeneous population. This population is normally located in a rural area where the cultural traits are
      cohesive. A local culture is a culture where the people involved are mostly located in one area. People involved
      in this culture try keep their culture alive by preventing the traits that distinguish them from other cultures.
      Interactions with other cultures may influence a local culture.Popular culture may be present in a large,
      heterogeneous population Popular culture is mostly apparent in urban areas where ideas and products may diffuse
      faster through Hierachical diffusion. Hierarchical diffusion follows a pattern from higher connectivity to lower
      connectivity. The begins from the hearth, or the city where the idea or product originated. It then follows a
      diffusion route to the deglommerated areas. Many of the products diffused are part of material culture.
      Architecture, art, culinary, and recreational activities may define a culture. The movement of these practices
      into other cultures is called culture appropriation. Popular culture is practiced by a large group of diverse
      people so it will fluctuate.Distance Decay is the idea of more distance leads to less interaction. Communication
      and transportation are lessening this idea by allowing interaction to increase no matter the distance. Time-space
      compression is a concept created by David Harvey that expresses the idea that the movement of products and ideas
      are accelerating. (et al, 2007)</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Identity is how we define anything or anyone. This status is
      constantly changing. This is because the surrounding environment is either letting us grow or knocking us down.
      Identifying against is when we compare and contrast ourselves to other people or things to let us realize who we
      are.(De Blij, Fouberg, Murphy, 127)</p>

      segregation as people of different races living in other spaces of the urban environment.(et al, 127) </p>

    <h1 style="color:white">The Basics of Language</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>language</strong> is a set of symbols and sounds that
      are used for communication. Language is a rather large part of culture. It describes experiences, values, and
      thoughts. A group of people that speak the same language generally have similar experiences, values, and thoughts.
      When a group of people are forced to give up their culture, their language usually disappears with the cultural
      practices. An example of this can be a result of colonization. A language can also coincide with what a group of
      people believe in. For example, some African languages do not have a word or term for the concept of a god, so
      most likely, these groups of Africans don&apos;t believe in a god (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.
      152-153).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Many societies have a standard language, or a language that is
      widely used and taught in the area. In some countries with an official language, all people working for the
      government must have passed an official state examination to test if the person can speak the language or not.
      <strong>Standard languages</strong> are usually put in place by the people who hold the power and influence the
      country. Most standard languages have many dialects under them. <strong>Dialects</strong> are variants of a
      language. The differences between dialects can be the vocabulary they use, the way words make up phrases, the
      pronunciation of words, the rhythm of speech, and the pace at which the speaker speaks. An
      <strong>isogloss</strong> is a geographic boundary that shows where a specific linguistic feature occurs.
      Isoglosses show where dialects are spoken. Usually, they are not a line because there are areas beyond isoglosses
      that speak the same dialect. <strong>Mutual intelligibility</strong> is a term used when two people speaking to
      one another can understand one another. There is an argument over if mutual intelligibility can be used to
      differentiate languages and dialects. Some say that languages arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t mutually intelligible, but dialects
      are. Linguists have rejected mutual intelligibility. Their argument is some languages, such as Scandinavian
      languages, may be understood by people speaking a different language, but some dialects, such as Mandarin Chinese
      and Cantonese Chinese, cannot be understood by people speaking a different dialect of the same language (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 155-156).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Language Distribution</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Languages are classified because some languages are related and
      others are not. The origin of the language determines its classification. The most broad classification of
      languages are <strong>language families</strong>. Language families are then divided into <strong>language
        subfamilies</strong>, or divisions within a language family. The individual language is the last level of
      classification. There are 15 major language families in the world. They are Indo-European, Afro-Asiatic,
      Niger-Congo, Saharan, Sudanic, Khoisan, Uralic, Altaic, Sino-Tibetan, Japanese and Korean, Dravidian,
      Austro-Asiatic, Austronesian, Trans-New Guinea and Australian, and Amerindian. The biggest of them all is
      Indo-European (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 157-159).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A Proto-Indo-European language is an ancestral Indo-European
      language that gives the hearth, or the originating place, of the Greek, Latin, and Sanskrit languages. A
      Proto-Indo-European hearth can link the modern languages from North America to Asia and Australia and from
      Scandinavia to North Africa. Right now, this is just a hypothesis. To test this hypothesis, there is some research
      to be done. The first task is to reconstruct the vocabulary. of Proto-Indo-European and its ancestor. The ancient
      ancestor of the Proto-Indo-European language is the Nostratic language. This language was around long before the
      First Agricultural Revolution in around 10,000 B.C. The second task is locating the hearth of the language. The
      third task is tracing the routes in which the language was diffused (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      160).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The Indo-European language family is divided into subfamilies,
      such as Germanic, Romance, and Slavic. The Germanic subfamily consists of English, German, Danish, Norwegian, and
      Swedish. These languages are found in Northern Europe. The Romance subfamily includes Spanish, Italian, French,
      Romanian, and Portuguese. These languages are found in the area where the Roman Empire once existed, such as
      Southern and Western Europe. The Slavic subfamily consists of Russian, Polish, Czech, Slovak, Ukrainian,
      Slovenian, Serbo-Croatian, and Bulgarian. These languages are found in Eastern Europe (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg,
      2007, pg. 165).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Language Diffusion</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Language is diffused by interaction between people. Long ago,
      languages were diffused by colonization and mercantilism. These two things established different networks of
      interaction and communication. In modern times, languages are largely diffused by trade. A <strong>lingua
        franca</strong> is a common language used by people who speak different languages for the purpose of trade and
      commerce. A lingua franca can be just one language, or it can be two or more languages combined. When people who
      speak two or more languages simplify the vocabulary and combine parts of the languages, the result is called a
      <strong>pidgin language</strong>. An example of a pidgin language is the Frankish language. It came from the
      Franks, or people living in southern France. This language combined Arabic, Greek, Spanish, and Italian. The
      Frankish language was also a lingua franca because it became the common language for trade in the Mediterranean
      Sea in during the 1200s. Over time, a pidgin language may become the native language for a group of people. When
      this happens, it is referred to as a <strong>creole language</strong>. The vocabulary and the structure of a
      creole language become more complex over time (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 168-169).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>monolingual state</strong> is a country in which only
      one language is spoken. Today, there are no true monolingual states. This is because of the diffusion and mixing
      of languages and the migration of people. A <strong>multilingual state</strong>, on the other hand, is a country
      in which more than one language is being spoken. In some multilingual countries, an <strong>official
        language</strong> (or official languages) is adopted. An official language is a language that is used to bring
      the people of the country together by using a primary language. The purpose of an official language is to allow
      communication and interaction between people who speak different languages. A global language can mean two
      different things. One meaning is a language that people use around the world in day-to-day activities. In this
      case, English is not a global language. The population growth rates are lower in English-speaking areas than
      non-English speaking areas. However, the other meaning is a common language used for trade and commerce around the
      world. In this case, English is a global language. Different countries communicate with each other using English,
      and tourists from different countries use English to find their way around the country they are visiting (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 169-171).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Language and Making Places</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Humans are responsible for making places. Places cannot exist with
      <strong>toponym</strong>, or the name of a place. According to Yi-Fu Tuan, when people change the toponym of a
      place, they have the power to &quot;wipe out the past and cal forth the new.&quot; Toponyms are part of cultural
      landscapes. You can find out about the history of a place by looking at changes in the toponym. When a country
      gets their independence, they usually change the toponyms of places named after the previous colonial figures.
      Also, the names of the cities and towns are often changed too. The new toponyms are called Post-Colonial Toponyms.
      After a change in power through a revolution or a coup, the toponyms of places occupied by the previous power are
      often changed. The new toponyms are called Post-Revolution Toponyms. The last type of toponyms are called Memorial
      Toponyms. The toponyms of places can be changed in order to memorialize an important person or event (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 171-174).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Religion and Culture</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Religion, like language, is a large part of culture. It reflects
      the identity of the culture. Religions are always changing. Migration and conversion aid in the diffusion of
      religions. <strong>Religion</strong> is defined by Robert Stoddard and Carolyn Prorak as &quot;a system of beliefs
      and practices that attempts to order life in terms of culturally perceived ultimate priorities.&quot; Cultural
      landscapes, such as places of worship, statues, cemeteries, and shrines, are inspired by religion. Religion
      influences dress, such as turbans, and personal habits, such as beards and ritual scars. Religion influences many
      societies; however, secularism now exists in some societies. <strong>Secularism</strong> is the idea that religion
      should not influence the government, education, or way of life in a society. Because of all of the controversies
      and arguments about religion, it is considered one of the most complex and controversial aspects of humans (de
      Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 179-181).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Origination and Diffusion of Languages</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Religions are put into three categories based on what they believe
      in. They are monotheistic, polytheistic, and animistic religions. <strong>Monotheistic religions</strong> believe
      in only one god. <strong>Polytheistic religions</strong> believe in more than one god. <strong>Animistic
        religions</strong> believe in inanimate objects. These religions believe there are spirits inside of the
      objects. A <strong>universalizing religion</strong> is a religion that believes their religion is the one true
      religion that offers a belief system that has universal appeal. Some examples of universalizing religions are
      Christianity, Islam, and Buddhism. The reason these religions are so large is because of their universalizing
      characteristic. Universalizing are actively looking for people to convert to their religion. <strong>Ethnic
        religions</strong> are religions that are specific to a certain group of people. Followers of an ethnic religion
      are born into it. These religions are not actively looking for people to convert to their language. An example of
      an ethnic religion is Judaism. By 500 BCE, the major hearths of philosophy and religion in the world were Southern
      Asia, the Eastern Mediterranean, and the Huang He River Valley in China (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.
      181-183).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">From the hearth of South Asia, two major religions were
      discovered: Hinduism and Buddhism. It is also one of the oldest modern world religions dating back 4,000 years
      ago. <strong>Hinduism</strong> is the third largest religion in terms of amount of followers. Hinduism
      doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have a single founder or an official origin. The origin of the religion is believed to be in the
      Indus River Valley. Hinduism is found mainly in India, and it follows the caste system. The caste system is a way
      of separating social classes by dividing people into castes, or classes. Hinduism diffused from what is known
      today as Pakistan to India and parts of Southeastern Asia. <strong>Buddhism</strong> is a religion that believes
      enlightenment comes through knowledge, the elimination of greed, complete honesty, and never hurting a fellow
      human being or animal. Buddhism was founded around 600 BCE by Prince Siddhartha, also known as the Buddha.
      Buddhism splinters off of Hinduism because of its very strict caste system. <strong>Shintoism</strong> is a small
      ethnic religion located in Japan. It is related to Buddhism, and its followers believe in worshiping ancestors and
      nature. Shintoism was the state religion of Japan from the 19th century to just after World War II (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 184-187).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">From the hearth of the Huang He River Valley, Taoism and
      Confucianism were founded. <strong>Taoism</strong> is a religion that focuses on living in harmony with nature. It
      was founded by Lao-Tsu, who published the book titled <em>Tao-te-ching</em> which means &quot;Book of the Way&quot;.
      <strong>Confucianism</strong> is a philosophy of life. It was created by Confucius. Confucius was appalled at the
      suffering of the poor in China. He wanted them to assert themselves. He believed that a person&apos;s
      responsibilities in a society should be determined by their abilities, not their heritage. Confucianism diffused
      to the areas surrounding China, such as Japan and the Korean Peninsula. These areas practice Buddhism today
      because of Confucianism (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 187-188).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">From the hearth of the Eastern Mediterranean, Judaism,
      Christianity, and Islam were founded here. <strong>Judaism</strong> is based on the teachings of Abraham. He
      united the Jewish people by worshiping one God. According to Jewish teachings, God and Abraham have a covenant, or
      an agreement, where the Jewish people worship only one God and God will protect the Jewish people. After the
      Romans destroyed Jerusalem, millions of Jews scattered across Northern Africa to the Iberian Peninsula and to
      Central Europe. This was known as the diaspora. The diaspora led to the diffusion of Judaism on the Iberian
      Peninsula and Central Europe. <strong>Christianity</strong> is based on the teachings of Jesus Christ. It is a
      monotheistic religion. According to Christian teachings, Jesus is the son of God. He was put on Earth to teach
      people about how to live their lives&apos; according to God&apos;s plan. Christians celebrate Easter, which is the
      day Jesus arose from the dead after being crucified three days earlier. Christians also celebrate Good Friday,
      which is the day Jesus was crucified. Worldwide diffusion of Christianity occurred in the the 16th century by
      European colonization. <strong>Islam</strong> is the youngest of the major religions. It is based off the
      teachings of Muhammad. According to Islamic teachings, Muhammad received a series of revelations. Muhammad
      preached verses of the Holy Qu&apos;ran, the holy book of the Muslims. The very strict Islamic law system is
      called <strong>Shari&apos;a Law</strong>. There are two divisions in the Islamic religion: <strong>Sunni</strong>
      Muslims and <strong>Shia</strong> Muslims. Sunni Muslims believe anyone who is capable of the job should be
      elected as the Muslim leader. Shai Muslims believe that the Muslim leader should be directly related to Muhammad
      or appointed by Allah. When he was alive, Muhammad had converted the kings on the Arabian Peninsula to Islam.
      These kings spread Islam by invading different areas on the Arabian Peninsula and Northern Africa. After that, the
      Arab empire expanded to Asia and other parts of Africa. This is how Islam diffused. <strong>Shamanism</strong> is
      a local faith in which people follow their shaman, or a religious leader, teacher, healer, and visionary.
      Shamanism is a big part of the local community it is in. Unlike religions such as Islam and Christianity,
      shamanistic faiths are small and usually isolated (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 189-194).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>sacred site</strong> is a place or space that has a
      religious meaning. In ancient times, sacred sites were often physical features, such as mountain peaks and rivers.
      In more modern times, sacred sites have been abandoned or altered, especially with universalizing religions. The
      city of Jerusalem is sacred to three religions: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. The most important sacred site
      for Jews is in this city. It is called the Western Wall, or the Wailing Wall. It is built at the edge of Temple
      Mount. Long ago, Jews built two temples on Temple Mount, but they were both destroyed by invaders. The Western
      Wall is all that remains of the second temple. The wall is a gathering places for Jews to come and offer prayers.
      Jerusalem is sacred to Christians because it is the place where Jesus&apos;s crucifixion took place just outside
      the city walls. After the crucifixion, Jesus was buried near the Cross because only kings can be buried inside the
      city. He rose from the dead three days later. The site of his tomb is located inside the Church of the Holy
      Sepulchre. The sacred site for Muslims in Jerusalem is a mosque called the Dome of the Rock. The Dome of the Rock
      is adjacent to the Western Wall. It symbolizes the place where Muslims believe Muhammad arrived from Mecca and
      went up to heaven. Instead of calling it the Temple Mount, it is called al-Haram al-Sharif, or the Noble Sanctuary
      (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 196-198).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The Hindu cultural landscape is filled with shrines. This is
      because the builder of the temple is receives merit and is rewarded. Hindus believe that the location of a temple
      should minimally disrupt the natural landscape surrounding it. Temples arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t far from water because they
      believe the Gods will not want to be far away from water (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 198-199).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Buddhists build temples and shrines that praise the Buddha. A
      pagoda is one of the more common structures associated with Buddhism. In Buddhism, the cultural landscape doesn&apos;t
      just involve architecture, it involves Bodhi trees as well. When Buddha reached enlightenment, he sat under a
      Bodhi tree in Bodh Gaya located in India. People that practice Buddhism visit the descendant of the Bodhi tree
      Buddha sat under as well as other trees where he might have taught under (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      199).</p>.
    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The cultural landscapes for Christianity have changed over time.
      In the Medieval Times, churches and cathedrals were the main focus with smaller building around them. Today,
      cultural landscapes can be the Vatican City for Catholics, a church, or even Christian cemeteries. In the United
      States, there is not only one form of Christianity, there are many. That is why there are many different types of
      churches spread around the US (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 201-202).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The majority of cultural landscapes in Islam are mosques. Usually,
      an Arab city&apos;s mosque is the nicest and best kept after building in the city. Also, the city of Mecca is a
      cultural landscape. All Muslims are required to make the hajj at least once in their lifetime. The hajj is a
      pilgrimage for Muslims to the holy city of Mecca. During the hajj, Muslims must go to the Great Mosque to walk
      around the al-Ka&apos;ba, a cube-like structure that is encased in silk. There is a black stone in the middle of
      the al-Ka&apos;ba that Muslims kiss. The hajj is one of the Five Pillars of Faith (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg,
      2007, pgs. 202-206).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Religion and Conflict</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Religion has been the basis of conflict for thousands of years.
      Some countries have interfaith boundaries, or boundaries between major faiths, while other countries have
      intrafaith boundaries, or boundaries within one faith. An example of interfaith boundaries would be many African
      countries that have a large Christian population and a large Muslim population. An example of intrafaith
      boundaries would be Northern Ireland with conflicts between the Catholics and the Protestants (de Blij, Murphy, &
      Fouberg, 2007, pg. 206).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The region of Israel and Palestine has been in conflict for
      centuries. After World War I, the British, who had control over the state of Palestine, created a homeland for
      Jewish people in Palestine. The British assured the world that the civil rights of the Palestinians would not be
      taken away; however, that did not happen. Conflicts between the Jews and the Palestinians started almost
      immediately. In the 1967 Arab-Israeli War, Israel took control of Palestinian lands in the Golan Heights, Gaza,
      and the West Bank. Over the last three decades, Jewish presence started to push farther into the West Bank. New
      housing settlements were being built and the city of Jerusalem was expanded eastward into the West Bank. In the
      mid-1990s, Israel awarded Gaza and parts of the West Bank with self-government. Now, these areas could govern
      themselves within Palestinian zones. Although the Gaza Strip has more freedom, the Israeli government still
      tightly controls what goes in and out of the Palestinian zones. Today, Palestine still attacks Israel through
      terrorist attacks. Nothing is safe from being blown up. And after a terrorist attack, the Israeli military goes
      into the Palestinian zones to hunt down suspects and kill people (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.
      206-208).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The Horn of Africa is not only a linguistically diverse region,
      but there are different religions here as well. The predominant religions are Islam and Christianity. The Amharic
      Christians control the Central Highlands of Ethiopia and other Christian groups control the southwestern parts of
      the Horn of Africa. Muslims control Somalia, most of Eritrea and Djibouti, a small part of Kenya, western
      Ethiopia, and northern Sudan. In 1950, the UN decided to make Eritrea part of Ethiopia. The Muslim Eritreans did
      not take kindly to being controlled by the Amharic Ethiopians. The Amharics continued to control the Eritreans and
      Somalis even after the government of Ethiopia was overthrown by a military dictatorship. The Eritrean&apos;s war
      for independence lasted 30 years until Eritrea got its independence in 1991. Even after Eritrea&apos;s
      independence, Ethiopia still had a large Muslim population in the eastern part of the country, a non-Muslim
      population in the western and southern parts of the country, and the population of Amharic Christians still
      dominate the Central Highlands of the country (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 208-210).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The conflict within former country of Yugoslavia was another
      conflict with interfaith boundaries. The two major religions were Christianity and Islam. Yugoslavia was located
      on the Balkan Peninsula in Europe. Out of the Christian people, the Slovenians and Croats in the western part of
      the peninsula were Catholic while the Serbians and Montenegrans in the eastern and southern parts of the peninsula
      were Eastern Orthodox. In the 1300s, the Ottoman Turks sent soldiers to convert some Serbian societies to Islam.
      The Ottomans took the region by force. There were now a Muslim presence in the middle and southern regions of the
      peninsula. A strong Muslim presence in Bosnia, Kosovo, and Macedonia. The actual country of Yugoslavia was thrown
      together after World War I. During World War II, fighting broke out between the pro-Nazi Croats and the anti-Nazi
      Serbs. During the war, the Nazi-backed Croats committed acts of genocide against the Serbs. Instead of helping
      this conflict, the new communist dictator of Yugoslavia, Josip Broz Tito, looked the other way. After the fall of
      the Soviet Union, Slovenia, Croatia, and Bosnia declared their independence. The leader of Serbia, Slobodan
      Milosevic, tried to force the republics to stay in Yugoslavia. War broke out between Croatia and Serbia. Both
      sides &quot;cleansed&quot; each otherÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s lands. Also, both sides attacked the Bosnian Muslims. The Muslims
      and Croats formed a coalition to fight against Serbia. A new plan was soon put into place by the UN. The countries
      that formerly made up Yugoslavia joined the UN. The plan called for the dividing of Bosnia and Herzegovina into
      two republics: one for the Serbs and one for the Muslims and Croats. Sixty thousand UN peacekeepers secure the
      border between the two republics. After the defeat of the Serbian leader, Slobodan Milosevic, hopes for the
      stability of the Balkan Peninsula began to raise. The situations between some of these countries is are very
      fragile, and it will take a while to regain the trust of each other&apos;s trust (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg,
      2007, pgs. 210-211).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The religious conflict in Northern Ireland is a rather non-violent
      one. However, there were still some violent acts and rebelling. The conflict is between the Protestant and
      Catholic populations in Northern Ireland. In the 1700s, England colonized Ireland. The colony served as a source
      of industrial wealth from the shipyards in the north. Catholics were the dominant religion in Ireland. Protestants
      soon migrated to the island because of the job opportunities. The Irish Catholics were treated badly by the
      English by denying them the right to own property or participate in the government. In the early 1900s, the Irish
      Catholics started to rebel against the colonization of Ireland. The Republic of Ireland was made up of 26
      counties. The six counties that made up Northern Ireland were voted to become part of the United Kingdom.
      Two-thirds of the population were Protestants, who possessed the economic advantages over the Catholics. British
      troops were brought into the area in 1968 after the terrorist attack made by the Irish Republican Army (IRA). The
      Catholics and Protestants that live in Northern Ireland segregate themselves from one another. Each group has
      their own neighborhoods, stores, newspapers, and holidays. In Belfast, Catholics and Protestants have started
      intermixing with each other in places like college campuses, shopping centers, and downtown clubs (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 211-214).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Religions are always changing. Sometimes, the people of a religion
      believe that their religion has changed too much. <strong>Religious fundamentalism</strong> is when religious
      leaders and followers want to return to the basics or foundations of their religion. This can come about from
      frustration over loss of religious authority, loss of a sense of local control, the breakdown of a society&apos;s
      values, and failure to achieve different economic goals. <strong>Religious extremism</strong> is religious
      fundamentalism that is taken to the point of violence. An example of extremism is the September 11attacks on the
      Twin Towers. Fundamentalists can be extremists; however, not all fundamentalists are extremists (de Blij, Murphy,
      & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 214).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white"> Unit 4- Political Organization of Space </h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Today a thematic approach to human geography is used in place of
      the traditional method. Old-style geographers required the memorization of countries and their capitals. Modern
      geographers are concerned more with the &quot; reasons for particular spatial distributions and the significance
      of the arrangements (Rubenstein, 2005, p.261).&quot; Even though the methods of teaching have changed, however, it
      is still important to know the locations of states in the modern world. This knowledge gives students a basic
      frame of reference. </p> <br>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> What is political geography? The study of the political
      organization of the world is political geography as political geographers study the &quot;spatial manifestations
      of political processes at various scales&quot; (De Blij et. al., 2007, p.222). For example, although nobody can
      predict where or when the next war will take place, political geography allows us to study both the cultural and
      physical factors that often are the reasons of political unrest in the world. Political geographers study the how,
      why, and what: How have people organized the Earth&apos;s surface into states and alliances? Why have they been
      organized in this manner? And what are the resulting conflicts that arise due to this arrangement? Additionally,
      political geography is also a study of the cooperation of states with each other, the boundary disputes, and
      terrorism (Rubenstein, 2005, p.261). </p>

    <h2 style="color:white">A Case Study- Changing Borders In Europe</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong> Let&apos;s imagine... </strong> you live in the village
      of Rittershoffen in France while you work in the German village of Worth. Although these two cities are only 30
      miles apart (50 kilometers), your daily journey to work forces you to cross the German-French border twice a day.
      How do you manage this? As a citizen of France, you face no difficulty crossing the border. No guards ask to see
      your passport or force you to pay custom fines on goods purchased. If you are late, the only consequence is heavy
      traffic on the bridge spanning the Rhine River, the border between the two countries.
      The border between these two countries has not always been like this, however. Let&apos;s take a look at this past
      of the German-French border:
    </p>

          the west bank of the Rhine River and the Vosges Mountains) from Germanic tribes.
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><strong>1870- </strong>Alsace and the neighboring region of Lorraine were captured from the French by
          Prussia, which eventually became the core of the new German empire.

      <tr>

    <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Although the border between France and Germany has cleared,
      border disputes still occur in Europe. The cities of Ljubljana and Zagreb, once both part of the country
      Yugoslavia, now are capitals of two different countries: Slovenia and Croatia. Travelers passing the border
      between these two countries must show a passport and concert currency. Similarly, travelers between Vilnius and
      Moscow (both once part of the Soviet Union) also must present a passport and exchange currency before crossing the

    <h2 style="color:white">How is space politically organized into states and nations? </h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Political geography, as you know, studies the spatial
      manifestations of various political processes at different scales. At the global scale, the world is divided into
      what are known as states. A <strong> state </strong>is a politically organized territory with a stable population,
      defined borders, and sovereign government along with being recognized as a state by the international community.
      Examples may be any countries, including China or Canada. What many of us do not understand, however, is that the
      modern division of the world into states is anything but stable or natural. &quot;The present day division of the
      world political map into states is a product of endless accommodations and adjustments within and between human
      societies (De Blij et al., 2007, p.222).&quot;
      <strong>Human territoriality </strong>is a term generally referring to the opinion of Robert Sack who describes
      human territoriality as &quot;the attempt by an individual or group to affect, influence, or control people,
      phenomena, and relationships, by delimiting and asserting control over a [specific] geographic area (De Blij et.
      al., 2007, p.222).&quot; There are several ways for a group to control another, including physical force or
      organized sets of laws. His view contrasts with that of Robert Audrey, who believes that human territoriality is
      similar to the general behavior of animals. By contrast, Sack believes that human territoriality is shown in many
      arrangements based on the settings (as the territorial strategy changes) and should not be compared to mere animal
      instinct. Human behavior is learned unlike animals where behavior is instinctive. Central to the idea of state is
      the concept of territoriality, making states such as the USA or Portugal examples of a territoriality. The concept
      of territoriality today is tied closely with the concept of sovereignty. <strong>Sovereignty </strong>is known as
      possessing independent control over a territory both politically and militarily (having the last say over their
      respective territory). For example, as a nation that is recognized as being a state is also recognized as being
      sovereign within the borders, the United States of America along with Great Britain. Under international law,
      states are sovereign, giving them the right to defend their <strong>territorial integrity </strong>from other
      states (De Blij et. al., 2007, p.223). </p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Modern State Idea</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> &quot;Because territoriality manifests itself in different ways,
      the idea of the state looked different in different regions of the world 400 or 500 years ago. The role territory
      played in defining the state and the sovereign varied by region (De Blij et al.,2007, p.223)&quot;. Europe was not
      the only one who had territorially organized political units. For example, in Native American tribes were not
      exclusive in that they often shared hunting grounds with friendly, neighboring tribes. Also, tribes held the
      territory, rather than by individuals in the territory, communally. The concept of territories and state-like
      political areas were evident in Southeast Asia. However, the European state idea deserves particular interest in
      that it was the foundation for the modern state system. Additionally, the Greek philosophies also play an
      important role in the modern state idea. From countries along the Mediterranean Sea, to Greek, Rome, and the
      United Kingdom, geographers can see several aspects of the modern state system.
      Negotiated in 1648, the <strong>Peace of Westphalia</strong> marked the beginning of the modern state in Europe.
      Concluding the major religious war in Europe (the Thirty Years&apos; War), the treaties were made up of a new
      language that recognized state and nationhood, clearly defined borders, along with guarantees of security. These
      treaties laid the foundation of territorially defined states in Europe. This peace also stabilized religious
      conflict in many parts of Europe. &quot;Thus, the political-geographic map of Europe in 1648 was fractionizing and
      evolving... The emerging political state was accompanied by mercantilism, which led to the accumulation of wealth
      through plunder, colonization, and the protection of home industries and foreign markets (De Blij et al.,2007,
      p.223).&quot; Finally, the descent of the absolutist rule created an increasingly wealthy middle class. This new
      modern state system allows for territories to define society rather than the society defining territory(De Blij et
      al.,2007, p.223).

    <h2 style="color:white">Nation-state</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> A <strong>nation-state</strong> is a politically organized space
      (a state) whose citizens are of the same culture (a nation). It is very rare when the nation and state occupy the
      same space, but it is what is preferred by most states and their governments (as the state is more stable with
      only one nation) as nations, not states, express the greatest nationalism. Even for the people, a nation-state is
      the &quot;ultimate form of political-territorial organization, the right expression of sovereignty, and the best
      route to stability (De Blij et al.,2007, p.226).&quot; Examples in the modern world include France and Spain (who
      built a single national identity from two or more divergent nations); Germany and Italy (who brought multiple
      similar nations together into one state); and Ireland, Norway, and Poland (whose nations separated to form
      different states) (De Blij et al.,2007, p.226).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">As you may have learned, very few places in the world have stable
      nations with well-defined borders. Most states satisfy the definition of a <strong>multinational state</strong>, a
      state with multiple nations within its borders. Yugoslavia is an example, as all the citizens never achieved a
      sense of the Yugoslav nationality. All the millions of people either identified themselves as Slovenes, Croats,
      Serbs, or a member of yet another ethnic group. Another possibility is a <strong>multistate nation</strong>, where
      a nation stretches beyond states&quot; borders. One example is shown in the overlapping nations of Hungary and
      Romania (The territory of Transylvania has frequently changed borders affecting the population). A <strong>stateless
        nation</strong> is a nation (defined cultural group) that has no specific state. In other words, these nations
      span between many diverse states. The Kurds and Palestinians are two examples of stateless nations (De Blij et
      al., 2007, p.228).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">European Colonialism and the Diffusion of the Nation-State Model</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Although often referring to the European colonization during the
      16th century (because of its magnitude and impact), <strong>colonialism</strong> is a general term that describes
      the rule of a country over an alien, separate people and place. The established settlements are imposed political
      and economic control by the autonomous power, often resulting in unequal economic and cultural relations. There
      have been two major waves of colonialism. The first in the 16th century involved Spain and Portugal and was later
      joined by Britain, France, the Netherlands, and Belgium and spread the European idea of capitalism. The second
      wave of colonialism occurred after the independence movements in the Americas during the late 19th century.
      Britain, France, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and Italy met for the Berlin Conference and divided the map of
      Africa. Although the reasons for these waves of colonialism were mainly for economic profit or for spreading
      religion (Christianity), these conquests were also responsible for laying the groundwork for the state system and
      capitalist world economy. Even after the end of colonialism, the organization of space and the world economy
      remained. However, the now independent colonies are still closely tied to the rest of the world. Diversely
      separated areas were tied together due to colonialism, producing what is today known as the world economy. Wealth
      is unevenly distributed around the world, ranging from HaitiÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s GNP of $510 and NorwayÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s of $42,222,
      but to truly understand the world economy, we must look at the big picture (De Blij., 2007, p.231).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Construction of the Capitalist World Economy</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Immanuel Wallerstein&quot;s research on the world economy can be
      simply put as three main points. The first is that the &apos;<strong>world economy has one market and a global
        division of labor </strong>(De Blij et al., 2007, p.232)&apos;. The world economy, as you may know, is
      capitalist. The capitalistic market began in the 15th century and spread through European colonialism, finally
      including the entire world by the 20th century. Rather than the government, in <strong>capitalism</strong> the
      people, corporations, or states (with the goal of earning a profit) exchange produced goods with the world market.
      Producers can commodify products and take advantage of the world labor supply to maximize profit. <strong>Commodification</strong>
      is a process used by producers to maximize profit involving selling, buying, and exchanging priced products.
      &quot;Companies create new products, generate new twists on old products, and create demand for the products
      through marketing (De Blij et al., 2007, p.232).&quot; Second, &quot;<strong>although the world has multiple
        states, almost everything takes place within the context of the world economy </strong>(De Blij et al., 2007,
      p.323).&quot; This is mainly due to colonialism, as although it was relatively simple for colonies to gain
      political independence, it is almost impossible for them to ever gain economic independence. This creates a
      tied-together economy, resulting in both positive and negative costs that ultimately change places. Finally, the
      last of the three points is that &quot;<strong>the world economy is a three-tier structure</strong> (De Blij et
      al., 2007, p.232)&quot;. The world economy is a three-tier structure: the core, the periphery, and semi-periphery.
      Core processes incorporate higher levels of education and include higher wages and more technology. There
      processes develop more wealth in the global economy. On the contrary, periphery processes include the lower levels
      of education and incorporate lower salaries and less technology (and generate less wealth to the world economy).
      Semi-peripheries, as you can imagine, are simply a buffer between the two extremes of core and periphery. This
      process generally includes the exploitation of the periphery by the core. Although these are processes, they occur
      in places and are sometimes assigned to states (as you can see in maps of the world economy). For example, the US
      and Canada are core states while Chile and Iraq are periphery.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</em></h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><em>A Sunday on La Grande Jatte</em> is a pointillist painting
      hung in the Art Institute of Chicago. Painted by the French painter Georges Pierre Seurat, the artwork
      demonstrates a post-Impressionist method of painting millions of points, each individual, single-color brush
      strokes. By taking a step back, you then see the full painting and how each dot contributed to the beauty of the
      complete work. This art is often compared to the world economy, for (as has been stated before) the world economy
      is made up of hundreds of states, but only by looking at the big picture do we understand the role of each &quot;dot&quot;
      in the whole (De Blij et al., 2007, p.232).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Political geographer Richard Hartshorne described two forces
      within a state as either centrifugal or centripetal. A <strong>centrifugal </strong>force divides a state or
      nation. Examples range from internal religious conflicts to political, ethnic, or economic differences. A <strong>centripetal </strong>force
      unifies the people within a common state or nation. These could be as simple as a national culture and common
      faith or even as complex as the unification during a war (De Blij et. al., 2007, p.234).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Form of government</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>federal</strong> system is a political system in which
      power is shared between the national and state governments. Examples can range from the United States (where the
      death penalty, the access to alcohol, and the concealed weapons are limited by states) or Nigeria (where the
      Muslim North follow Sharia law and the South, being Christian or animist, do not). Although there is variation to
      the extent at which a State is federal, this system often allows a government to keep its state unified. This type
      of system is considered the most expressive political system, by Australian geographer K. W. Robinson, as it
      allows for regional differences to coexist. On the contrary, a <strong>unitary</strong> system is a political
      system where the state is not divided into provinces or territories but where the state is governed as a
      centralized unit, often not accommodating the outlying, minority regions. Most European governments were unitary
      until the end of World War II. Modern examples include the United Kingdom or France (De Blij et. al., 2007,
      p.235).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Electoral Geography</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Because the Constitution of the United States establishes a system
      of <strong>territorial representation</strong>, it is important to understand that the spatial organization of the
      districts determines who is represented and impacts who is elected. The process by which districts are redrawn and
      moved so that they encompass an even number of people (for equal representation) is known as <strong>reapportionment</strong>.
      This occurs every ten years in the United States, the same time the census is taken to count the population of the
      State. Reapportionment and redistricting main goal is equal representation, along with compact contiguous
      districts and equality of racial and linguistic minorities. Examples include gerrymandering, the drawing of
      districts to favor certain groups, and <strong>majority-minority</strong> method, requirements allowing minorities
      representation. Being named after Governor Elbridge Gerry, the term <strong>gerrymandering</strong> defines the
      process by which districts are drawn and redistricted to favor a group. Although gerrymandering occurs today, it
      is often for the reason of giving representation to the minorities. Another example of gerrymandering is during
      the 1950s and 1960s in the United State, a time when minorities (African Americans) were often refused to vote.

    <h1 style="color:white">Agriculture</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Throughout the units of human geography, often we note
      differences between a less developed country and a more developed country. In this unit we will discover one of
      the most prominent differences between a more and less developed nation. LetÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s start with the United States
      or Canada. There are very few full farmers, and even these are more involved with machinery and computers than the
      average office worker. This results in the canning and preservation of foods. When you go to the grocery story to
      pick up food, you rarely are reminded of farmland. This highly mechanized and productive farming method is
      fundamentally different from a still-developing nation. Almost all of ChinaÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s population are subsistent
      farmers, who work only to feed their families with little (if any) surplus to trade (Rubenstein, 2005, p.261).
      Agriculture affects almost every part of society, and without agriculture human civilization would have been
      nearly impossible. Not only does it provide us with food, but it even creates work-field for several people
      (including farmers, scientists, and businesspeople). Economics is also tightly tied with agriculture as it is a
      global market. Even the government takes control of many agricultural aspects, as distribution of food to people
      is vital (Rhoades, 2011). In this unit we look at how agriculture has changed from the very first historic-records
      of it to modern-day, commercial agriculture and how agricultural methods vary around the world.</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">What is agriculture, and where did agriculture begin?</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Agriculture is the deliberate cultivation and domestication of
      plants and animals for human benefit (subsistence or economic gain) to produce food, clothing, feed, industrial
      products, and fuel (Rhoades, 2011). Although when we think of agriculture, we think of food, only about half of
      all the staple grains grown in the United States are actually consumed by people. Another huge portion of
      agriculture in the United States is used to feed livestock (Blij, Fouberg, &amp; Murphy, 2006, p.331). Food
      products can either come from &quot;plants or from animals that eat plants. Such crops as corn, rice, and wheat
      provide food for billions of people. These crops also can provide food for livestock animals, which are raised for
      their meat, milk, or eggs. Some crops are grown to make fuel for automobiles. Others, such as cotton and linen,
      are used to make clothing and other materials (2011),&quot; says Robert E. Rhoades, distinguished research
      professor of anthropology at the University of Georgia.</p><br>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">&quot;A common way of classifying economic activities is to focus
      on what is being produced (Blij et al., 2006, p.331).&quot; Agriculture, for example, is considered a primary
      activity. The figure below explains the different levels of economic activities.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Hunting, gathering, and fishing were the major sources of food
      before agriculture was developed (known as foraging), and it occurred everywhere in the world (Rhoades, 2011).
      Sizes of groups and types of food eaten depended mainly on location, climate, and resources. While certain groups
      may have eaten nuts, others may have hunted for caribou herds (Blij et al., 2006, p.332). Before plant and animal
      domestication, the animals and plants the hunter-gatherers ate looked very different from what they do today
      (Rhoades, 2011).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Terrain and Tools</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Hunter-gatherers, before developing agriculture, had worked to
      perfect tools, control fires, and modify their environments based on their needs. For example, one important
      achievement for human communities was the development of fire. Although the first opportunities to control fire
      were natural (from lightening or combustion of surface heated coal), people soon realized that fire could be
      created with the rapid hand rotation of a wooden stick in a small hole around dry tinder. Fire became a sign of
      community as it was the focal point of settlements. It was not only a means to hunt animals, but also assisted in
      making food digestible (Blij et al., 2006, p.332). </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In addition to the development of and containment of fire, human
      communities began to alter their environments even before agriculture had been developed. For example, in the
      fishing field, by cutting off patches of standing water from the open sea, humans were able to harvest fish such
      as shellfish. Humans began to make use of the various migration cycles of animals and fish. During the winter, in
      addition, people even began storing food (Blij et al., 2006, p.332).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">The First Agricultural Revolution</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>First Agricultural Revolution</strong> is the name of
      what has been marked as the first deliberate tending of crops and breeding of animals. According to geographer
      Carl Sauer, the hearth of <strong>plant domestication</strong> was Southwest Asia, also called the Fertile
      Crescent, over 14,000 years ago. The areas combination of human settlements, forest margins, and fresh water
      streams is believed by many geographers to be the start of root crops (plants grown from the roots or cuttings of
      another). The process we all know is referred to as seed crops (reproduction of plants by cultivating seeds) and
      is much more complex, requiring seed selection, sowing, watering, and well-timed harvesting. He belived in only
      areas of plenty would the necessary experiments for the establishment of agriculture and the settlement of land
      take place. Although it is believed the hearth of agriculture was the Fertile Crescent, the practice developed in
      many different places and at many different times. People all over the world discovered agriculture allowed for a
      reliable food source and more permanent settlements (Blij et al., 2006, p.333).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The Stone Age is the period between 2.5 million years ago to
      approximately 3000 BC. The period is termed the Stone Age because humans during the time used tools made of stone,
      rather than of metal. The period is followed by the Bronze Age, the time when bronze replaced stone. The Stone Age
      is divided based on the varying tool making techniques: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods (Fagan,
      2011).The transition from the Paleolithic period (old stone age) to a more settled way of life including animal
      domestication and agriculture is described as the Neolithic Revolution (EncyclopÃƒÂ¦dia Britannica, 2011),
      otherwise termed the First Agricultural Revolution.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Let&apos;s take a look at the Stone Age and see how it went about
      the first agricultural revolution.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Perceived to have occurred as early as 8000 years ago, <strong>animal
      domestication</strong> occurred after the starting of agriculture and in steps. Goats, sheep, pigs, and several
      other animals became part of human communities, and these animals changed considerably since then (It has been
      proven by archaeologists that animals generally became smaller over time, as when penned up, animals donÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t
      have to worry about predators or catching prey. In addition, people choose to keep the more calm and docile of the
      animals, modifying over time the total appearance of the animals themselves.) Animal domestication began when
      animals were kept as pets for ceremonial purposes. Dogs and cats attached themselves to human settlements very
      early. The animals themselves may have kept close to human settlements, forging through the trash or protecting
      themselves from predators. Humans spread the word quickly, for there were several advantages of animal
      domestication: as for carrying heavy burdens, being a source of meat, and providing us with milk (Blij et al.,
      2006, p.336).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A country is developing if there is progress made in technology,
      education, and socioeconomic welfare. The three major areas of concern with developing countries are development
      in economic welfare, development in technology and production, and development in social welfare. A common way to
      measure a country&apos;s development in economic welfare is finding the gross national product, or GNP. <strong>Gross
        national product</strong> is a measure of a country&apos;s officially recorded goods and services produced by
      its citizens and different corporations in a given year. The GNP includes goods and services produced inside and
      outside a country&apos;s borders. GNP is much broader than <strong>gross domestic product</strong>, or GDP. Gross
      domestic product includes only goods and services produced inside a country&apos;s borders in a given year.
      <strong>Gross national income</strong>, or GNI, calculates the financial worth of what is produced in a country
      plus the income received through investments made outside of the country. Economists have turned to GNI because it
      is a more accurate way of determining a country&apos;s wealth in relation to a global economy. A common way to
      standardize GNI data is to look at it as per capita GNI. To find the per capita GNI of a country, divide the GNI
      with the population of the country. GNI is a limited measurement because it only includes the country&apos;s
      <strong>formal economy</strong>, or the monitored economy that is taxed by the government. The country’s <strong>informal
        economy</strong>, or the illegal or uncounted economy that isn&apos;t monitored or taxed. Informal economies can
      have a great impact on the country&apos;s overall economy (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs.302-303).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The development of technology and improvements in production is
      another way to measure the development of a country. You can take the percentages of the workers employed in
      different sectors of the economy. A less developed country has a high percentage of workers in the food production
      sector. A more developed country has a high percentage of workers employed in the technology and service
      industries. Also, a person&apos;s access to different modes of transportation and different forms of communication
      is another way of assessing the development of a country using technology (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      304).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The development of social welfare is another way to measure the
      development of a country. Dependency ratios are common ways to measure the development of social welfare in a
      country. A dependency ratio is a measure of the number of dependents that each 100 employed people must support.
      Usually, the lower the dependency ratio, the less economic and social strain there is. Some other methods of
      measuring the development of social welfare in a country are literacy rate, life expectancy, infant mortality, and
      amount of savings per capita (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 304).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Walt Rostow&apos;s Ladder of Development model, also called the
      modernization model, shows the steps of development in countries. His model has to assume that all countries
      develop the same. There are five stages of development in this model. The first stage is called traditional. The
      main activity in countries at this stage is subsistence farming. These countries have a rigid social structure.
      The people of the country often refuse technological change. The second stage is called preconditions of takeoff.
      In this stage, there is a new leadership that moves the country towards diversity and flexibility. It prepares the
      country for the next stage. The third stage is called takeoff. During this stage, the country goes through
      something similar to an industrial revolution. Urbanization and industrialization start to occur. Improvements in
      technology and productions start to happen. The economy then enters the fourth stage called drive to maturity.
      During this stage, modernization starts to spark in important parts of the country. New technologies begin to
      diffuse, and industrial specialization starts up throughout the nation. Also, the population growth rate starts to
      slow. Only some countries reach the fifth stage. This stage is characterized by higher worker incomes and a
      widespread production of goods and services. The service industry develops greatly. Much of the country&apos;s
      workforce will be concentrated in the service sector. Rostow&apos;s model has received criticisms just like other
      development models. The problem with his model is it doesn&apos;t provide any context to development (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 305).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Development and Geography</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Development happens in context. Context is using various scales to
      tell what is happening to a country and then combining those scales. To understand why the wealthiness of a
      country is different than the wealthiness of another, you have to look at not only at it from a state scale, but
      also from local, regional, and global scales too. Today, many scholars argue that poorer countries are going
      through neo-colonialism. Neo-colonialism happens when major world powers control the economies of less developed
      and poorer countries, even though the poorer countries are independent states. Development scholars have produced
      a number amount of theories called structuralist theories. A <strong>structuralist theory</strong> explains that
      economic inequality was built into the world economy. The <strong>dependency theory</strong> was created by
      structuralists. It states that political and economical relationships between countries and regions control and
      limit the development possibilities for poorer countries or regions. An example of this is colonialism.
      Colonialism created political and economical structures that made the colonies become dependent on the colonial
      power. This dependency helps sustain the regions with more prosperity and poverty in other regions. This can still
      happen after decolonization occurs (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 305-308).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Immanuel Wallerstein&apos;s world-systems theory states that the
      social changes in the developing world are directly related to the economic activities of the developed world.
      Wallerstein divided the world economy into the three-tier structure. This consists of the core, periphery, and
      semi-periphery. Core processes are processes that generate wealth in a place. This is because these processes
      require greater technologies, higher levels of education, and higher salaries. When core processes are put in a
      certain place, it brings in wealth for the people of the community. Periphery processes are the opposite of core
      processes because require little education, lower technologies, and lower salaries. Core regions are regions that
      have reached high levels of socioeconomic prosperity. These regions are big players in the global economic game.
      Periphery regions are poor the depend greatly on the core. They do not have much control over their economical or
      political affairs. Semi-periphery combines both core and periphery processes. Places of semi-periphery act as a
      buffer between the core and periphery in the world economy. Semi-periphery countries have more power than
      periphery regions; however, core regions still have a large influence on semi-periphery countries.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Barriers and Costs of Economic Development</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The world economic system is a problem for peripheral countries,
      but it is not the only problem. There are other barriers they face that slow them from developing economically.
      These barriers are low levels of social welfare, foreign debt, political instability, and the widespread disease.
      Peripheral countries face social problems that make economic development hard to accomplish. From a demographic
      perspective, peripheral countries have high birth and death rates with a low life expectancy. In fact, over half
      the population in peripheral countries is either 15 or younger. This is a problem because there are less adult
      laborers and more dependents. The low life expectancy and high infant mortality rates come from not having
      adequate nutrition. Lack of education is also a big problem. Many school-aged children do not attend school
      because everyone has to pay to send their children to school, even the poor. Peripheral countries have some of the
      highest illiteracy rates in the world. Usually, boys attend school longer than girls. Trafficking is when adults
      and children are manipulated into working under conditions that they would normally not choose. These adults and
      children are often seeking a better life when they get manipulated into trafficking. Trafficking is not considered
      slavery because no one is being sold (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 309-310).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Foreign debt is a big problem for peripheral countries.
      International financial institutions lend money to newly independent countries in the 1960s. Private banks and
      lending firms in the United States, Europe, and Japan recently started to lend peripheral countries money.
      Starting in the 1980s, the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund started to loan very large amounts of
      money to peripheral countries for the purpose of development. These loans were given out in exchange for reforms
      in the county&apos;s economy or government, such as reducing tariffs and opening the country to foreign trade.
      These loans were called structural adjustment loans. Both the IMF and the World Bank required the countries they
      loaned money to to make structural adjustments in exchange for the loans. Now the peripheral countries owed money
      to these organizations. When a peripheral country spends a large portion of its budget on debt repayments, it has
      less money to spend of the development of the country. Many countries&apos; debts (including interest) are more
      than their revenues. This created a debt crisis for the poorest countries in the world (de Blij, Murphy, &
      Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 310-311).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Political instability is a very common problem within peripheral
      countries. Political instability in these countries is a result of the competition between the wealthy for control
      of the government and the disenfranchisement of the poor. It is hard for peripheral countries to maintain
      political stability. This is because their democratic governments failed, and most were taken over by military
      coups. Many countries have gone back and forth between a democratic government to a military government. Experts
      say it is a democratic government cannot be maintained without wealth. Politicians usually become corrupt in areas
      where there is much poverty. When a government becomes corrupt, they cut off the development aid to country by
      spending the money for other reasons that do not help the country. Core countries and other nongovernmental
      organizations try to help the country when this happens, but it is usually never enough to meet the basic need.
      Many corrupt government leaders stay in power for decades because the people are intimidated by the leader and the
      leader&apos;s followers. Those that do speak out against leader are often either killed or harmed by the
      government. The countries that do manage to overthrow their dictator have a long road ahead of them to getting
      their country back on track (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 311-312).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Diseases are very common in peripheral countries. Diseases
      directly affect the development of the country’s economy by weakening the labor force and making survival a
      challenge. <strong>Vectored diseases</strong> are diseases that start with one host and get spread to other hosts.
      Vectored diseases infect many people in the periphery. These infectious diseases spread quickly throughout host
      populations infecting more people each day. Malaria is a very common vectored disease in the periphery. Malaria is
      a disease carried by mosquitoes. This disease is caused by a parasite in the mosquitoes&apos; saliva. Every year,
      2 to 3 million people die from malaria, most of them being under the age of 5. Malaria is all over the
      world,especially in sub-Saharan Africa, China, Southeast Asia, the tropical Americas, and in India. Other species
      of monkeys, rats, snakes, and birds can be infected with malaria. There are anti-malaria drugs on the market, but
      in order to stop it, the mosquitoes must be eliminated. The government of Sri Lanka, formerly known as Ceylon,
      launched a huge attack on mosquitoes in the 1940s using a pesticide called dichloro diphenyl trichloroethane, or
      DDT. The mosquitoes were almost wiped out, and the number of deaths associated with malaria significantly went
      down. DDT turned out to cause health and environmental problems, so it went out of use. Today there is a new
      tactic to fighting malaria. Special engineered mosquitoes are being released into the wild. These mosquitoes are
      genetically modified so that they can not transmit this disease anymore. The purpose of these mosquitoes is to see
      the number of mosquitoes that are not genetically modified decrease sharply. Also, in efforts to stop malaria,
      many programs have started to distribute mosquito nets so people are protected when they sleep at night (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 312-315).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Economic development is great for a country. However, there are
      still costs associated with economic development. This does not mean costs in money but more along the lines of
      physical costs. The three main areas of economic development that have costs associated with them. They are
      industrialization, agriculture, and tourism. The governments of many peripheral countries have set up special
      zones that focus on exporting called export processing zones, or EPZs. These EPZs offer favorable trade
      agreements, tax, and regulatory to foreign businesses. The two best known EPZs are the Mexican maquiladoras and
      the special economic zones in China. These zones are put near places that have easy access to export markets. The
      maquiladora zone is directly across from the United States-Mexico border. The special economic zones are located
      near ports. These zones attract a variety of manufacturing operations. The Mexican government designated the
      northern region of Mexico as the site for the maquiladora. They used this region so that the manufactured goods
      could be sent into the United States free of import tariffs. The maquiladora process began in the 1960s. It did
      not really take off until the 1980s. The wages were much lower in Mexico, so American manufacturing businesses
      began to relocate to the maquiladora region of Mexico. Today there are about 2000 manufacturing plants in this
      region. Over 600,000 people are employed by these plants. About 20% of Mexico’s industrial labor force was
      concentrated in the maquiladora region. Many environmental regulations are not followed resulting in air and water
      pollution in that region. In 1992, the North American Free Trade Agreement, or NAFTA, between the United States,
      Canada, and Mexico. NAFTA facilitated the movement of manufacturing plants and service industries to Mexico. The
      two districts where the new plants are located are Tijuana under San Diego and Ciudad Juarez across from El Paso,
      Texas (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 315).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Agriculture in peripheral countries can either mean personal
      consumption or large scale production for a large agricultural company. Agriculture has modernized in these
      countries for the large scale production for the foreign market. This does not make a large impact for the
      surrounding areas. The distribution systems are usually poorly organized so not much food is grown for the local
      market. The land owned by the local population is usually fragmented, or divided into small plot of land that
      makes it challenging to farm efficiently on. Most farmers have outdated equipment and tools that are very
      inefficient. The crops that are usually grown are grain and roots. This is because these crops produce a high
      yield. Fertilizers are luxuries that cannot be afforded. Also, the farmers know little about soil conservation.
      The common result of this is soil erosion. Countries that face severe soil erosion and have dry climates next to
      deserts are at high risk of desertification, or the process of desert expansion into farming lands.
      Desertification has hit Africa very hard. Most of the African continent is arid or semiarid. People have no choice
      but to farm in these conditions. Some farmers and ranchers have turned some of these arid lands and made them into
      lands that can be used for farming and ranching. These lands are generally used more intensively to increase
      agricultural productions. In the last 50 years, more than 270,000 miles of farming land have become part of the
      desert in sub-Saharan Africa. Humans are the main cause of the desertification. Soil exhaustion, overgrazing,
      woodcutting, and misuse have sped up this process in this region of the world (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007,
      pgs. 315-317).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Peripheral countries have become favorite tourist destinations
      among travelers for wealthier countries. Tourism has its ups and downs; however, the downs greatly outweigh the
      ups. Really, the only major upside to tourism is it is a source of revenue and employment to the country. The one
      of the downsides of tourism is the country has to invest in tourist attractions, hotels, and other infrastructure
      necessary for tourism. The materials used for building hotels and other tourist buildings takes away from building
      houses for the citizens of the country. The majority of the income that the country receives from hotels is from
      the tourists&apos; consumption of food, water, and electricity. Most of the money is reinvested in building other
      infrastructure, such as cruise ports and airports. The tourism industry pays its employees low wages. Most have to
      work more than one job just to support themselves and their families. Many locals resent the wealthier tourists in
      their poorer societies. Tourism can also change the cultural landscape of a place. Huge hotels stand over the
      poorer housing that the locals live in. Also, hotels serve many meals a day while children are starving and
      suffering from malnutrition down the street. Even though tourism has many downsides to it, the local communities
      still rely on the tourist industry as a source of income (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 317-319).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Uneven Development Within States</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Poverty is not limited to the periphery. In fact, core countries
      have areas where people live in poverty and unemployment rates are high. These areas include Indian reservations,
      inner cities, rural towns, and regions hit by a natural disaster. The governments of countries have an influence
      in core processes. This affects if and how the country will produce wealth. In core countries, most of the farmers
      are well educated in agribusiness and plant and animal sciences. Farming in core countries has become a core
      process. For example, the dairy industry is very mechanized. Computers and other systems decide the amount of food
      a cow gets to eat. Extensive records are kept on the animals as well. This is all usually done through the use of
      bar codes. Also, governments can put <strong>quotas</strong>, or a limit on the number of a certain good that can
      be imported, on the number of products imported into the country. This is usually because they want the products
      made in their country to sell more than the same product made in a different country (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg,
      2007, pgs. 319-322).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Capital cities are very important economically and politically to
      a country. A way to create wealth in a country is to place well-paying government jobs in the capital city. Also,
      capital cities are a country’s headquarters and serve as the seat of government. Capital cities are usually the
      most influential cities in a peripheral country. After gaining independence, many peripheral countries move their
      capital city away from where there was a large colonial presence. This is because they either want to create a
      city to reflect the common culture of the country, or they want to extend economic development towards the center
      of the country. Often times, a large corporation will move a city and build it up. This is usually because there
      is a resource the corporation needs. Also, it develops the city by practicing different corporate activities. An
      <strong>island of development</strong> is a city where economic development is concentrated. These cities are
      built up by either a government or a corporation. Many people migrate to these cities because they have more
      opportunities for work and a better life (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 322-324).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Nongovernmental organizations</strong>, or NGOs, are
      organizations, not run by a state or local government, that try to improve the lives of people who are in poverty.
      They are independently run, and most, if not all, are non-profit organizations. Every NGO has its own set of goals
      and missions. These groups can be based out of anything from churches to charities. One specific program founded
      by NGOs is called the <strong>microcredit program</strong>. This program gives out loans to poorer people to
      encourage them to start a small business. To get as many loans repaid as they can, these programs promise future
      lending to people who repay their loans or they have the women guarantee each other’s credit. Because of this, the
      repayment rate is at 98 percent (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 324-326).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Industrial Revolution</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The Industrial Revolution began in the late 1700s in Great
      Britain. The Industrial Revolution improved industrial technologies that transformed the process of manufacturing
      goods. It changed the way goods were produced in a society, and it changed the way people got a hold of food,
      shelter, and clothing. The foundation of the Industrial Revolution was technology. There were more than just
      industrial inventions; there were new social, economic, and political inventions. The Industrial Revolution did
      not happen over night; The diffusion of new ideas and techniques took decades. Before the Industrial Revolution,
      products were made in a person&apos;s home. This was known as the cottage industry. The invention of the steam
      engine, patented in 1769 by James Watt, was the most important to the development of factories. It helped
      transport goods so factories could be built farther away from where the goods were going (Rubenstein, 2005, pg.
      341).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Manufacturing needed to be located next to coalfields and water
      ports. As a result of this, large urbanized areas developed next to the coalfields. The largest urbanized area was
      the Midlands of north-central England. In the first half of the 1800s, the Industrial Revolution diffused to
      mainland Europe. Manufacturing still had to be near coal fields and water ports. Many urbanized areas sprung up
      across Europe in the southern part of the North European Lowland. This area consisted of northern France, southern
      Belgium, central Germany, western Czech Republic, and central and southern parts of Poland. Manufacturing grew
      once the railroad was built. It moved to existing urban areas with large markets, such as London and Paris (de
      Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 365-367).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Location Theories and Industrial Location</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Primary activities are activities that deal with extracting
      resources from the Earth. Secondary activities are activities that manufacture the resources that were extracted.
      Improvements in transportation have made secondary activities less dependent on the resource location. Secondary
      industries don&apos;t have to be located next to the primary activities because raw materials can be transported
      over long distances. Now, manufacturers have to find the right place to put their business. A location theory
      predicts where a business should be located. Models for the location of secondary industries have to assume that
      the manufacturer wants to maximize their profit and take variable costs into account, such as energy costs
      transportation expenses. Friction of distance is a key issue in trying to maximize advantages. Friction of
      distance is when time and cost increase when the distance increases. An example of this is a raw material being
      shipped across the country. The the cost of shipping the material will go up, but you can sell the product for a
      greater price to make a profit (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 367-368).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Alfred Weber, a German economic geographer, developed a model for
      the ideal location of a business. His model was called the Least Cost Theory. The Least Cost Theory finds the
      ideal location of a business by using three categories of costs that would minimize costs. These categories are
      transportation, labor, and agglomeration. The first category is transportation. The location had to result in the
      lowest possible cost of shipping raw materials to the manufacturing plant and the finished goods to the market.
      The second category is labor. Putting a business in an area where labor is cheap is ideal. If the business is put
      far from the resource location, the low cost of labor would make up for the transportation costs. The third
      category is agglomeration. Agglomeration is when many businesses are clustered in one area. This saves money
      because the equipment and furniture one company needs can be made by another company in the same area. The costs
      of transportation is greatly cut down (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 368).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Harold Hotelling created the locational interdependence model. It
      states that two business competitors will try to take away from each other&apos;s territories in order to maximize
      sales. This would eventually result the two businesses selling their products across from each other. To explain
      this, Hotelling used two ice cream vendors selling ice cream on a beach. They both start by selling at opposite
      ends of the beach. After a while, both vendors try to maximize their sales by moving closer to the customers at
      the middle of the beach. Eventually, these vendors end up selling across from each other. The whole point of
      Hotelling&apos;s analysis was to show that the location of a business cannot be fully understood until it is
      referenced with the location of other businesses just like it (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 368).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In 1967, August Lösch wanted to determine the where the best sites
      for building manufacturing plants were in order to maximize profit. He added the influence of consumer demands and
      production costs to his calculations. Businesses usually locate themselves in an area where the can make a profit.
      This is how Lösch&apos;s model works. He said the ideal place for a manufacturing plant would be in an area where
      production and transportation costs were low and income is high (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 369).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Before 1950, manufacturing plants were next to the raw materials
      and transportation routes. There was only a small number of major industrial economies. There are four primary
      industrial regions. These include Western and Central Europe, Eastern North America, Russia and Ukraine, and
      Eastern Asia. In Western and Central Europe, Germany was and still is a major industrial power. There are three
      manufacturing districts in Germany: the Rühr, the Saxony district, and Silesia. The Rühr was a great industrial
      area in Europe. This district has many advantages to it. Since it is located near the Rhine River, it has good
      accessibility, and it is close to other markets. In the 1930s, the Rühr became one of the most important
      industrial regions in the world. The Rühr specialized in heavy manufacturing. Saxony specialized in lighter
      manufacturing. It was known for manufacturing textiles, ceramics, and optical equipment. Silesia was originally
      part of Germany, but it is now located in Poland and the Czech Republic. This region is based on the coal
      resources found in the region (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 369-370).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Europe had a serious rival at the beginning of the 20th century:
      North America. Manufacturing in North America started in the New England region of the northeastern United States.
      Because this region is not rich in natural resources, they have to be imported from other countries. One resource
      that does not have to be imported is coal. North America has very large coal reserves. These reserves are some of
      the largest reserves on Earth. Coal is distributed all over the country. There are steel plants built by the sea
      because there is a lot of iron ore that is imported here from other countries. After World War I, the United
      States rose as an industrial super power. Even after the Stock Market Crash in1929, the United States was still
      the dominate industrial power. Canada was also an industrial power. The American Manufacturing Belt is located in
      the northeastern region of the United States and a small portion of the southeastern region of Canada. The New
      England region and New York specialize in light manufacturing. The Southeast Pennsylvania district is located in
      this manufacturing belt. Iron ore was smelted in this district for a much of the 20th century. Early
      industrialization began in New York. This area contains tens of thousands of industrial establishments. New York
      is has a very large and important market, but like Paris and London, it does not have natural resource reserves.
      One of the world&apos;s greatest ports is located here. This port is a major break-of-bulk point. A break-of-bulk
      point is a place where cargo from on form of transportation is moved to another form of transportation. The
      Upstate New York district is farther east than the New York district. In the early 19th century, the Erie Canal
      was dug in order of connecting the East Coast and the Great Lakes. This caused population growth in this area.
      There are many specialty manufacturers here. For example, in Buffalo produces steel and Rochester produces cameras
      and other optical equipment. The Southern Ontario district serves as a linking point between Detroit and Buffalo.
      The area around Montreal near the St. Lawrence River is part of the Canadian industrial zone. This area is no
      where as big or as industrialized as the Ontario district, but it has one advantage over it. It gets cheap
      hydroelectric power. Paper-making and aluminum-refining industries are concentrated in the Montreal region. The
      industrial heartland of the United States includes the Pittsburgh-Cleavland area, the Detroit-southeast Michigan
      area, the Chicago-Gar-Milwaukee area, and smaller areas surrounding these larger areas. Here, iron ore and coal
      factories were replaced with factories that produced things like bulldozers, tanks, and harvesters (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 370-374).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In the former Soviet Union, Moscow had an important market,
      converging trade routes, a large labor force, and strong centrality. Before heavy manufacturing was added in,
      there was already light manufacturing taking place in the area. The Soviet Union contained a vast amount of raw
      materials. These raw materials include metallic ores (copper, iron, nickel, chromite, bauxite), coal, timber, and
      water. One of Russia&apos;s oldest manufacturing centers is St. Petersburg and its surrounding areas. It was the
      capital of the country during the time of the Tsar Peter the Great. Medical equipment, optical products, and
      high-quality machines were manufactured here. During World War II, many factories were disassembled and moved to
      the Volga River area located in moder day Southwestern Russia. This area is now one of Russia&apos;s most dominant
      industrial regions because of the movement of factories and industries during the war. During the last few decades
      of the 19th century, Ukraine and surrounding areas started to industrialize. After World War I, Ukraine was
      annexed by the former Soviet Union. The Soviets used the rich raw materials and industrial potential from Ukraine
      to rise as an industrial superpower during the mid-twentieth century (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg.
      374).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">China and Japan were the only Asian countries that underwent
      large-scale industrialization. Out of these two countries, Japan&apos;s industrialization started first. Japan
      became a leading industrial country less than a century after the Industrial Revolution took place. Japan&apos;s
      economy was built on government policies about industrialization and capital from colonization. Economic
      development in Japan started in the second half of the 19th century. Soon there were Japanese colonies in Korea,
      Taiwan, and mainland China. At the end of World War II, the Japanese economy was hit hardly; however after a few
      decades, Japan rose to be an economic superpower. The Kanto Plain is Japan&apos;s main industrial region. It is
      home to one-third of the Japanese population as well as the capital city of Tokyo. This region contains a harbor,
      and it is central to the whole country. Many businesses moved their headquarters to Tokyo. This region produces
      more than 20% of the country&apos;s total output. After Japan lost its colonies after World War II, the country&apos;s
      industries continued to prosper. This was because of Japan&apos;s highly skilled work force. Japanese products
      were all over the global market. Eventually, this all led to higher prices and wages. The search for countries
      where cheap labor could be found had started (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 374-377).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Changes in Industrial Production</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">New innovations in the production process triggered a
      manufacturing boom in the 20th century. One of the more significant of these innovations was the mass-production
      assembly line invented by Henry Ford. The assembly line allowed for the mass-production of goods in a single
      place. Ford&apos;s idea was called the <strong>Fordist</strong> system. Fordist was basically a way of organizing
      labor and production. Many countries and corporations supported each other under the Fordist system. Today, the
      world economy follows a <strong>post-Fordist</strong> system. This system includes production practices that where
      the goods are not mass produced. Production is mainly outsourced to different countries around the world.
      Time-space compression is the idea that many regions of the world are more connected through different
      communication and transportation technologies. Fluctuations in one economy can affect another around the world in
      a few minutes. When regions of the world were more connected, goods were produced closer to where the demand was.
      Now, goods can be produced anywhere in the world and can be transported to where the demand is. <strong>Just-in-time
        delivery</strong> is when goods can be transported to corporations around the world when they are needed. This
      creates a global division of labor, or when corporations hire workers form all over the world. The global division
      of labor has changed the role of different economic sectors within a country&apos;s economy. For example, the
      agricultural industry has become very mechanized and very efficient. Also, many manufacturing companies have moved
      to semi-peripheral or peripheral countries. This results in core countries having a large labor force concentrated
      in the tertiary sector of the economy (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 377-378).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">During the post-Fordist era, there were new influences on the
      location of industries besides low wages. They are intermodal transportation, regional and world trade agreements,
      and the availability of energy. Efficient modes if transportation allow manufacturers to purchase raw materials
      from a great distance and transport finished goods across a great distance. An <strong>intermodal
        connection</strong> is a location where two or more modes of transportation meet up. This reduces the cost of
      transportation as well as makes it easier to ship goods. The container system is a revolutionary invention in the
      transportation sector. It allows for goods to be shipped in large, metal containers. These containers can fit on
      many forms of transportation, such as cargo ships, trains, and trucks (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 379).
    </p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Trade organizations, such as the North American Free Trade
      Agreement (NAFTA), have trade agreements that set up quotas for the location of production for imported goods.
      Many governments have done the same thing between other governments. Most governments belong to the World Trade
      Organization (WTO), which negotiates and regulates rules of trade among countries in the trade organization. The
      trade agreements made by the WTO work to push the world into free trade. Most of the regional trade agreements try
      to do away with the quotas and tariffs between these member countries. Regardless of if it&apos;s a regional or a
      global trade agreement, it will affect what is produced in the area and the location of the production (de Blij,
      Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 379).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Coal was once the main power source of manufacturing plants. In
      the middle of the 20th century, oil and natural gas started to take over. Many countries depended on foreign oil
      and natural gas. Manufacturing plants have always been near the energy source that powers them. During the
      Industrial Revolution, many factories were built near coal fields for easy transportation of the coal. Oil and
      natural gas changed the concept of being located next to the an energy source. Oil and natural gas are distributed
      worldwide through pipelines and tankers. The new important aspect of energy sources is securing one. This is a
      national priority for most countries. The United States consumes 27% of the world&apos;s total amount of
      petroleum, and the United States consumes 37% of the world&apos;s total amount of natural gas. In 2001, the US
      need a minimum of 20 million barrels of oil a day to power the manufacturing plants and modes of transportation in
      the country. Like petroleum, the United States consumes and produces a large amount of natural gas. There is more
      than 2.5 million miles of pipelines in between the United States (including Alaska) and Canada (de Blij, Murphy, &
      Fouberg, 2007, pgs. 379-380).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Modern Manufacturing Belts</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Many manufacturing regions have gone through <strong>deindustrialization</strong>
      in the last 20 years. Deindustrialization is a process in which corporates move out of one region and into another
      region that has cheap labor. This results in a period of unemployment in the deindustrialized region. The regions
      where the corporations move to become the new manufacturing regions. Many areas in Europe and in the United States
      are deindustrialized. These areas were beat out by other regions in the world that had cheaper labor. The
      northeastern region of the United States is sometimes called the Rust Belt because of the abandoned factories (de
      Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 381).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Most of China&apos;s industrial growth occurred under communist
      rule. One of the goals of China&apos;s communist government was to transform and develop the country&apos;s
      resources and industries when they took over in 1949. China is a very large country land mass wise. There are many
      coal deposits that are easy to reach because they are right under the surface of the ground. The coal is also good
      quality. New iron ore deposits are also being discovered. Many new industrial regions were created in China by the
      communist government. The Northeast district, also called Dongbei in China, became the industrial heartland of
      China. Heavy manufacturing is based in this district. It is located in the Liao River Basin. There is steel
      production to the south of the district, and there is lighter manufacturing, such as textiles, to the north of the
      district. The Shanghai and the Chang District is the second largest industrial region in China. It is built around
      the city of Shanghai, which is China&apos;s biggest city. Many different products are manufactured here, such as
      railroad cars, books, food, and ships. This district is described as the pacesetter for China&apos;s industrial
      growth. China has an enormous labor force and low wages. These two factors greatly attract businesses to the
      country. The Northeastern part of China is China&apos;s Rust Belt. Many state-owned factories have been either
      sold or closed. High unemployment rates are found here, and economic growth has ceased. However, this region is
      expected to recover because of its resources and geography. Many countries have <strong>outsourced</strong> to
      China. This means they have moved their businesses there and resume production in a different country. When this
      outsourced work is moved off the shore of the country, it is called <strong>offshore</strong>. Much of the
      outsourced work in China has started to move into the interior of the country (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007,
      pgs. 381-382).</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Service Industries</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In the 1970s, many factors led to inflation rates and financial
      instability in the global economy. Some of these factors are large growth in governmental activity, a rise in
      labor activism, and the costs of communication and transportation decreased. These factors challenged the Fordist
      system. In order for core regions to sustain a competitions advantage over other regions, they had to undergo
      significant readjustments. These readjustments would lead the core regions into the service industry. A service
      industry is also called a tertiary industry. These industries perform a service; they do not create a tangible
      product. Service industries are broken up into two divisions: quaternary and quinary industries. Quaternary
      industries collect, process, and manipulate capital and information. These industries include legal services,
      finance, insurance, and computer services. Quinary industries involve important decision making and advancements
      in human capacity. These industries include scientific research and higher level management jobs. Service
      industries are not the only aspect of the changing global economy. Other aspects include increased mechanization
      of production (mainly in the core), the growth of major multinational corporations, and the dispersing of the
      production process (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 383).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Many industrial regions across the world have started to
      deindustrialize into service industries. The most successful countries happened to be the wealthier countries.
      This means that the core is starting to transition into a service economy. Even though the core has less
      manufacturing than the periphery, the core industrial regions still dominate the periphery&apos;s industrial
      regions. In fact, 75% of the world&apos;s total amount of manufacturing comes from North America, western Russia
      and Ukraine, Eastern Asia, and Western Europe. The <strong>Sun Belt</strong> is the southeastern region of the
      United States all the way to the southwestern region of the United States. Many companies have settled in this
      long stretch of land because of the warm climate and the local laws. This resulted in population and economic
      growth in the Sun Belt. The eastern part of the Sun Belt is mainly secondary, or manufacturing, industries (de
      Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007, pg. 384).</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The factors that determine the location of a service industry
      differ from those that determine the location of a manufacturing plant. The easiest way to look at these factors
      is to talk about each of the following separate: tertiary, quaternary, and quinary. The most important factors for
      the location of tertiary industries is the location in relation to consumers. The business will not do well if it
      is too far away from the consumers. For quaternary industries, there are different factors because this category
      is more diverse. Retail banks and other administrative services are usually located near their clients because
      they require a high amount of in-person contact. Man other industries set up where ever they can as long as they
      have access to telecommunications and digital processing technologies. In the quinary sector, thee industries are
      usually located near areas where quinary activities occur. Because of the vast amount of scientific research being
      done at universities, many quinary activities are located near these schools (de Blij, Murphy, & Fouberg, 2007,
      pgs. 384-386).</p>

    <h1 style="color:white">Why Cities?</h1> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> Across the globe, more people are living in urban
      <strong>cities</strong> and towns than rural areas. A city is an area of people and buildings clustered and
      grouped together that act as a unit for a center of politics, culture, and economics. The majority of the world
      population is indeed <strong>urban</strong>. An urban area includes the central city area, as well as the suburban
      realm. In other words, an urban area is the city and its surrounding environs connected to the city. The rise of
      urbanization shows how the economy of the world is shifting from localized agriculture to the globalization of
      businesses. The change in urbanization also shows how easy it is to move in the modern, globalized world. Without
      long journeys on foot or deadly sailing trips to worry about, it has become quite simple to drop everything and
      move. </p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> &quot;Human communities have existed for over 100,000 years, but
      more than 90,000 years passed before people began to cluster in towns&quot; (De Blij, Murphy & Fouberg, 2007, p.
      260). This quote shows that urbanization is actually a recent affair. Cities today model the modern size and
      structure of urban areas from the past 200 years. Before people actually began living in cities though, they had
      to switch from hunting and gathering to agriculture. When people began to plant crops, they would have to stay
      with their fields in order to reap the harvest. One of the first forms of cities were <strong>agriculture
        villages</strong> , which were small villages that were based on agriculture. Because of this, the people had to
      live on just enough to get by, or near subsistence levels. The homes in agriculture villages were about the same
      size with same number of possessions. These villages showed <strong>egalitarian nature</strong>, which just means
      that goods were shared equally among the people. Two components that enabled the formation of cities were <strong>agricultural
        surplus</strong> and <strong>social stratification</strong> which work hand in hand. Agriculture surplus is, in
      simple terms, extra crop yield that is more than what the farmer and their family needs. The surplus can be sold
      for a profit. Social stratification is the separation of a population into classes. Which class a person is a part
      of depends on factors such as wealth, power, production, and prestige. Of course, not all cities are agriculture
      based. &quot;In citiees, people generate personal material wealth, trade over long distances, live in stratified
      classes that are usually reflected in the housing, and engage in a diversity of economic activities- not just
      agriculture&quot; (De Blij et al., 2007, p. 261). This means that the innovation of the city was really the first
      urban revolution.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The 5 Hearths of Urbanization </h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"> A <strong>hearth</strong> is a point at which diffusion explodes
      outwards. Human geographers have defined five hearths as the basis of urbanization expansion. These hearths are
      <strong>Mesopotamia</strong>, the <strong>Nile River Valley</strong>, the <strong>Indus River Valley</strong>, the
      confluence of the <strong>Huang He and Wei River Valleys</strong>, and <strong>Mesoamerica</strong>. Each hearth
      has its own characteristics and traits that make it such a leader in urbanization. </p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Mesopotamia</strong> is the first hearth. It is located in
      an area of Southwest Asia called the Fertile Crescent. This hearth includes all the great cities between the
      Tigris and Euphrates rivers. Mesopotamia exhibited social inequality, which meant that there was a separation
      between the upper and lower classes. The urban elite built walls around their palaces and hired artists to
      decorate their homes. The people of Mesopotamia created a priest-king class, which supported religious leaders,
      along with a religious-political ideology to support them. This meant that the rulers were in charge of both
      religion and government. These individuals had tasks like levying taxes and collecting part of the harvest
      presented by agricultural workers. Opposite of the urban elite were the ordinary citizens. Typical homes were
      packed together like mud-walled sardines, the only thing separating one from its neighbor was a narrow lane. These
      were better than the huts of poor citizens, smeared with mud and reeds. Workshops lined the roads, mud walls
      surrounded the city, and in the middle was an early type of CBD filled with houses and shrines. Temples were large
      buildings and were built on mounds of dirt over 100 feet high. There was a complete lack of sanitation, so disease
      was a major cause of death.</p>
    <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>Nile River Valley</strong> is the second hearth of
      urbanization that began around 3200 BC. Interestingly, archeologists debate whether the Nile River Valley is truly
      a hearth, or if it&apos;s just diffusion from Mesopotamia. It would appear as if the agricultural techniques and
      methods diffused from Mesopotamia. However, there is evidence that supports independent urbanization in this area.
      The introduction of irrigation made this hearth unique from the rest. There was also an absence of walls around
      the city. The Nile River Valley had singular control, where the power coincided with control of the irrigation
      system. In addition to the normal architecture, there were also the great pyramids, tombs, and the sphinx, all
      which were built by slaves.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Hearths of Urbanization cont. </h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The third hearth of urbanization is the <strong>Indus River
      Valley</strong>, and like the Nile River Valley, it seems as if it diffused from Mesopotamia. However, this hearth
      is unique in its intricate city plans. The hearth originated in 2200 BC. Just like the Nile River Valley, it is
      likely that the agriculture in the third hearth diffused from the Fertile Crescent. Scholars have found ancient
      Indus writings, but have not been able to decipher them yet. The first cities of this hearth were Harappa and
      Moheenjo-Daro, whose city structure suggests that the third hearth had a leadership class. All homes had access to
      the same infrastructure, such as wastewater drains and wells. Thick walls surrounded the cities, where scholars
      believe that there was a lot of trade due to coins discovered around gateways in the Mediterranean.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The fourth hearth of urbanization arouse around the <strong>Huang
      He</strong> and <strong>Wei River Valleys</strong> and dates back to 1500 BC. The center of the city was a
      vertical structure centrally located within the city. The structure had an inner wall built around it, which
      surrounded temples and palaces for the leadership class. Located near China, this urbanization hearth was in
      charge of the building of the Great Wall of China around 200 BC. This hearth was also responsible for the creation
      of the legendary 7,000 Terracotta Warriors of China.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The final hearth of urbanization is <strong>Mesoamerica</strong>.
      Mesoamerican cities were all focused on religion, meaning they were theocratic. The rulers had divine right,
      virtually making them God-kings. Such cities included Yucatan, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>

      Moheenjo-Daro, whose city structure suggests that the third hearth had a leadership class. All homes had access to
      the same infrastructure, such as wastewater drains and wells. Thick walls surrounded the cities, where scholars
      believe that there was a lot of trade due to coins discovered around gateways in the Mediterranean.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The fourth hearth of urbanization arouse around the <strong>Huang
      He</strong> and <strong>Wei River Valleys</strong> and dates back to 1500 BC. The center of the city was a
      vertical structure centrally located within the city. The structure had an inner wall built around it, which
      surrounded temples and palaces for the leadership class. Located near China, this urbanization hearth was in
      charge of the building of the Great Wall of China around 200 BC. This hearth was also responsible for the creation
      of the legendary 7,000 Terracotta Warriors of China.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The final hearth of urbanization is <strong>Mesoamerica</strong>.
      Mesoamerican cities were all focused on religion, meaning they were theocratic. The rulers had divine right,
      virtually making them God-kings. Such cities included Yucatan, Guatemala, and Honduras.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Ancient Cities</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Ancient Cities</strong> were the centers of religion,
      power, and the economy. The cities were the main portals for trade, where wealthy merchants, land/livestock
      owners, and traders operated. Education came from teachers and philosophers that lived in the ancient cities.
      Handicraft industries were valued high in the communities, and they served as magnets for the best craftspeople
      and inventors. Ancient cities played an important role in cultures and societies around the world. Being the
      centers of most religion, trade, education, and travel, ancient cities attracted a variety of travelers,
      tradesmen, priests, and pilgrims. However rural villages had different city landscapes than towns and cities.
      Cities had structures to hold travelers, like hotels and inns, prepare food for sale, collect raw materials, hold
      worship celebrations, and house soldiers. However, compared to modern cities, these ancient cities were not very
      large. Many of the urban hearths did probably reach their maximum population and sustainable size. Factors that
      affect sustainability include the production, gathering, and distribution of food, as well as social organization.
      The urban hearths were rare exceptions in an extremely agricultural dominant society.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Greece and Rome</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">You can see evidence of Ancient Greece and Rome everywhere you
      look. The influence of the two empires has been exponential. Each country does have its own characteristics,
      though. First, take a look at Greece.</p>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">By 500 BC, Greece was one of the most urbanized countries in the
      world, which brought a rush of urbanized cities. In fact, the city of Knossos was the true cornerstone of the
      Minoan civilization. Athens and Sparta were the main Greek cities, and at the time, Athens was the largest city in
      the world. Like cities from the 5 urban hearths, the Greeks would place their most important buildings on high
      points. Unlike the others, though, Greeks didn&apos;t build the mounds, but used natural elevations. The most
      impressive building in Greece was built on the highest point, called the Acropolis. The architecture techniques of
      the Greeks have been copied numerous times throughout history. Another focal point of Greece was the Agora, the
      market place of the country. There was a plentiful amount of trade routes between Greece and other cities, as well
      as between the Greek islands. Entertainment took place in large theaters, where plays and other events were held.
      There were still poor living conditions, however. Though Greece wasn&apos;t an urbanization hearth, the country
      still had a global impact. In fact Roman culture and urbanization diffused from Greece.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Rome had an extremely large urban system, which required much
      thought for the placement. Rome had regional planners who were exceptional at choosing the <strong>site</strong>
      of Roman cities. The site is the absolute location that is an optimum location for trade, defense, and religion.
      Regarding the religion, Roman mythology is almost completely based off of Greek figures. You can see the
      similarities from the other country in Rome&apos;s city structure; Romans had a rectangular street grid pattern,
      and instead of an acropolis and agora, Rome had the forum. Entertainment took place in the Colosseum, where
      competitions, war games, ceremonies, and other public events were held. Often Gladiators ad Christians were thrown
      into the Colosseum to fight to death for entertainment. Romans were both rich and poor, and slavery was a very
      large part of society. 1-2 out of every 3 Roman citizen was a slave.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Second Urban Revolution</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">To recap, the first urban revolution was the formation of cities.
      This included the five hearths of urbanization, as well as some other prominent ancient cities. The second urban
      revolution directly coincided with the industrial revolution. Cities had to adapt to the sudden rush of incoming
      citizens. But before industrialization could have another revolution, there had to be an increase in food
      production. This happened thanks to a series of agriculture innovations including the seed drill, hybrid seeds,
      and improved breeding practices. When the workers no longer were required to be at the fields, they were free to
      move to the cities to find work. A key factor for creating an industrial city was proximity to a power source.
      Nearness to water was also important for some cities, such as mercantile cities. Others required to neighbor coal
      and oil fields.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Unfortunately, when cities began to industrialize, there was a
      complete lack of regulation. Slums, failed sewage systems, pollution, all of these were prominent issues arising
      with industrialization. Living conditions were bad, but working conditions were even worse. With no child labor
      laws yet in place, children were forced to work dangerous jobs for long hours with a pay of next to nothing.
      Finally, in the second half of the twentieth century, things started to turn around. Factories were repositioned,
      and cities moved the manufacturing companies away from nice living areas. Overtime, factories were abandoned, only
      ghosts of industrialization remaining in Ã¢â‚¬Å“rust beltsÃ¢â‚¬Â around the world. However, the urbanization
      brought about by the industrialization of cities is still present today.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">The Placement of Cities</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Cities around the world are located where they are for specific
      reasons and multiple factors. Urban geographers are always searching for these reasons, and they use many
      techniques. Using quantitative data, urban geographers sometimes look at the <strong>trade area</strong> of a
      city. The trade area is simply the region where a city has a dominant influence. Two other factors that affect a
      city&apos;s location are population and distance. Urban geographers have made conclusions about different sized
      cities called the <strong>rank-size rule</strong>. This rule states that the largest city in an area has the
      largest trade area due to the most transportation. Medium-sized cities trade in smaller areas of commerce and are
      scattered from the major city. Small towns house the grocery stores and other necessities. The smallest villages
      may have a small shop or gas station. A hierarchy forms based on population and trade area. The rank-size rule
      also states that the population of a city is inversely proportional to its hierarchical rank. The rank-size rule
      is not always present in countries that have a city that is much larger than the rest, like Paris or Mexico City.
      This rule doesn&apos;t state the location or placement of cities, though. </p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>central place theory</strong> was created by <strong>Walter
      Christaller</strong>. This model predicts how and where central places in the urban hierarchy (cities to villages)
      would be distributed based on their function and placement. The model is based on a few assumptions. The first is
      that the surface of the ideal region would be flat with no physical barriers, such as mountains or rivers.
      Secondly, that the soil fertility would be universal, so agriculture could take place anywhere in the city. Third,
      population and purchasing power would be evenly distributed. Next, transportation would be uniform and be
      available from one region to the next. Finally, any good or service could be sold anywhere and in every direction
      out to a certain distance. The model is set up so the largest central place would provide the most functions to
      the majority of the region. His model isn&apos;t circular, but actually a collection of hexagons that fit
      perfectly together. You can see an example of Christaller&apos;s model in the <strong>Sunbelt phenomenon</strong>
      in southern regions. Henry Ford said, in regard to the central place theory, &quot;[The central place theory can
      still add] analytical power to the understanding of patterns of urban growth, even in this era of fast and
      long-distance transportation, suburbanization, and multiple urban functions.&quot;</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Each city model shows <strong>functional zonation</strong>, or the
      practical division of a city into zones based on their function. There are many zones that are important to
      understand before looking at any models. The <strong>Central Business District(CBD)</strong> is a concentration of
      businesses and commerce in the center of a city. A CBD is usually associated with high real estate values,
      skyscrapers and tall buildings, traffic, converging highways, and mass transit systems. <strong>Central
        city</strong> is a term to describe a strictly urban area that has no suburban traits. The central city is
      sometimes synonymous with the older part of a city versus the newer suburbs. A <strong>suburb</strong> describes a
      uniform part of an urban area that is usually adjacent to the city. Suburbs are generally residential, but you can
      find other features like schools, malls, and office parks as well. <strong>Suburbanization</strong> is the spread
      of cities into surrounding areas that were previously uninhabited. It is typically a transition from rural to
      urban.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">There are three models for the North American city. The first is
      the <strong>concentric zone model</strong>, created by <strong>Ernest Burgess</strong>. His model divides the city
      into 5 concentric zones based on their function. The CBD is in the center, then the zone of transition. A zone of
      independent workers&apos; homes is third, surrounded by middle-class residents, and finally enclosed by the
      suburban ring. This model is dynamic, so as the city grows, the zones can change.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Homer Hoyt</strong> created the <strong>sector
      model</strong> in the late 1930s. This model focuses on residential patterns, explaining why the wealthy live
      where they do. The sector model is divided into pie slices, where each zone occupies a certain slice.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Chauncy Harris</strong> and <strong>Edward Ullman</strong>
      created the <strong>multiple nuclei model</strong> which was sort of a compromise between the sector and
      concentric zone models. This model shows the CBD is losing its dominancy as the main nucleus and proposes that
      suburban areas also have their own nuclei. However, even this model is said to be too simple for a modern city.
    </p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">With the technology and transportation innovations, areas outside
      the cities began to grow, creating <strong>edge cities</strong>. An edge city is a small city on the outside of a
      large, influential city. These smaller cities attract suburbanites with workplaces, shopping, leisure activities,
      and other urban elements. This causes the ties between central cities to loosen. This created the term <strong>urban
        realm</strong> to describe the spatial components of the modern metropolis where each realm has a function. It&apos;s
      the best model to describe the most recent urbanization in America.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>Griffin-Ford model</strong> models the Latin American
      city structure. The model has a thriving CBD and other sectors coming out from it. The model also has <strong>disamenity
        sectors</strong> which are the very poorest parts of cities. In extreme cases, these areas are actually separate
      from the city services and are run by gangs and drug lords. These are known as barrios, or slums.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Since the beginning of the century, <strong>Africa</strong> has
      been the site of the lowest levels of urbanization in the world. The majority of the people living in Africa are
      farmers and the urbanization rates in some areas are less than 40%. There is a lot of diversity in African cities
      due to the influence of various European countries, therefore making it difficult to create an accurate model.
      African cities typically have 3 different CBDs, including a colonial, traditional, and market zone variation.
      There is evidence of vertical development in the colonial CBD. The traditional CBD includes single-story buildings
      with some traditional architecture. The market zone is an informal, open, forum-type <em>market</em>. However, it
      is still extremely important for their economy. There are traces of developing sectors defines ethnic and mixed
      neighborhoods. African cities are surrounded by a ring of squatter settlements.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">The <strong>McGee model</strong> is the model for a typical
      Southeast Asian city. This part of Asia is the location for many populous cities, including Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta,
      and others. McGeeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s model puts the central point of the city as the old colonial port zone combined with a
      large commercial district surrounding it. There isnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t a formal CBD, but parts of a CBD strewn around the
      city. The parts include the old colonial port, government, Western commercial, alien commercial, and the mixed
      land-use sections. This model also includes squatter areas, suburbs, and other zones</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Creating a City</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Cities are created by people and institutions. Social and cultural
      preferences affect where a city will be placed. These preferences also affect where people live. The <strong>cultural
        landscape</strong> of a city is unique for each one. Home styles, distance between streets, vegetation around
      the houses, and even space allotted for automobiles all make up the cultural landscape of a city.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">There appears to be negative correlation regarding the population
      and prosperity of cities; as the population increases, the prosperity of the region decreases. <strong>Pull
        factors</strong> can contribute to this because people move to cities in search of a better life. Unfortunately,
      the cities cannot keep up with the incoming flow of immigrants, so the quality of the housing depletes. These
      cities develop <strong>shantytowns</strong>, which are unplanned developments of homes that arenÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t
      structurally sound, and are typically made of crap wood, iron, pieces of cardboard, etc. However, these poor
      conditions do not have any effect on the high rates of incoming populations. Higher quality cities enforce
      <strong>zoning laws</strong> which show the use of space that is acceptable for most of the community. The laws
      are based on cultural preferences and environmental regulations.</p> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">One way of making a city is to remodel a neighborhood. You could
      also change the layout of a current city to represent the modern goals and aesthetics. <strong>Redlining</strong>
      is the illegal trick used by realtors where redlines represent neighborhoods or areas that are sketchy. Banks
      would refuse to give loans to anyone living in these areas. The debt of the red-lined neighborhoods would spiral
      out of control. Another illegal realtor trick known as <strong>blockbusting</strong> was where a realtor would
      tell families that the neighborhood was to be a popular racial neighborhood. This would cause many families to
      sell their homes, which the realtors would sell back to the racial families for unfair prices. This practice is
      also illegal today. <strong>Commercialization</strong>, which is a perfectly <em>legal</em> practice can be seen
      in many urban areas. It is simply the practice of designing a central city that appeals to businesses and
      tourists. When people move back into these newly urbanized areas, it is known as <strong>gentrification</strong>.
      It is most common in areas with a tight housing market and defined central city neighborhoods. <strong>Tear
        downs</strong> is almost like a suburban gentrification. It occurs when people buy a house simply to tear it
      down and build a larger home on the land. The new, larger home is sometimes referred to as a
      <strong>McMansion</strong>.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">Whenever an area goes through a sudden urbanization where homes,
      businesses, and roads are built with disregard for urban planning, it is known as <strong>urban sprawls</strong>.
      Urban sprawl is pretty universal, but it is especially present in the Sunbelt and the West where there is an
      incline in population size. To counteract this urban spread, architects have created a design called <strong>new
        urbanism</strong>. It is an idea that you can create an urban community with less traffic, cheaper homes, more
      jobs, and so much more. You can see this idea being put into place in cities like Seaside, Florida. Another type
      of community is a <strong>gated community</strong>. These are fenced in neighborhoods that have controlled access
      gates for residents. These appeal to a variety of people.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Ethnic Neighborhoods</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">A <strong>European ethnic neighborhood</strong> usually consists
      of immigrants from other colonies and countries. The colonies are usually ones that were once part of that
      country, such as Algerian neighborhoods in France. Alternately, Germany has different neighborhoods for ally
      countries, such as Turkey. The European government is extremely involved in the social rights of their people,
      which is slightly different from the US. Due to the age of EuropeÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s cities, they are more suitable for
      walking rather than automobiles. A benefit to the citiesÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ age is the amount of historic tourist
      attractions. Housing and work locations are meshed together, where businesses will be on the bottom floor and
      rooms up above. However, zones of transition are home to unemployment, crime, resentment, and more. Whether a city
      has ethnic neighborhoods depends on the government, though.</p><br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;">In cities of periphery and semiperiphery, slums usually begin to
      form where the permanent buildings end. Sometimes they can surround the central city, almost smothering it. If you
      go to a city like this, you would see how the makeshift homes cover every foot, except for a few trees and narrow
      footpaths, in every direction. Slum areas consist of dangerous shelters, and the government doesnÃ¢â‚¬â„¢t have
      the resources to supply education, food, housing, or police. However, some settlements require rent for land that
      has recently been owned or used for farmland. Ethnic conflict often occurs between newcomers and people who have
      lived there for some time and are successful. Often present in shantytowns like these are <strong>informal
        economies</strong> that are free from taxes and do not contribute to the governmentÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s economy.
      Unfortunately, this is not good for the government or its economy. It might not be preferred, but the slums are a
      way of life.</p>

    <h2 style="color:white">Globalization</h2> <br/>

    <p style="margin-left: 10px; margin-right: 10px;"><strong>Globalization</strong> is the modern trend of everything
      interacting at a global scale. One thing that functions at this level is a <strong>world city</strong>. You can
      probably think of a few right off the bat: New York, London, and Tokyo are just a few. Some of the world cities
      are also <strong>primate cities</strong> for their country. These cities are kind of like generic representatives
      for the views and aesthetics of their country. Across the globe, the media is constantly creating <strong>spaces
        of consumption</strong> where viewers, readers, listeners, etc. can go to consume their products. A universal
      example is Walt Disney. Everyone has been to the park, watched the movies, read the books, or seen references on
      TV. Disney does this on purpose to create an entertainment space where you will be encouraged to invest in their
      products. This can be seen throughout hundreds of media outlets throughout the modern world.</p>
