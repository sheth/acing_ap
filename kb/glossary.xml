    <title>Core/periphery Model</title>
    <description>The world economy is a three-tier structure: the core, the periphery, and semi-periphery. Core processes incorporate higher levels of education and include higher wages and more technology. There processes develop more wealth in the global economy. On the contrary, periphery processes include the lower levels of education and incorporate lower salaries and less technology. Semi-peripheries, as you can imagine, are simply a buffer between the two extremes of core and periphery. This process generally includes the exploitation of the periphery by the core. Although these are processes, they occur in places and are sometimes assigned to states. For example, the US and Canada are core states while Chile and Iraq are periphery.</description>

    <id>territoriality</id>
    <title>Territoriality</title>
    <description>Human territoriality is a term generally referring to the opinion of Robert Sack who describes human territoriality as "the attempt by an individual or group to affect, influence, or control people, phenomena, and relationships, by delimiting and asserting control over a [specific] geographic area (De Blij et. al., 2007, p.222)." There are several ways for a group to control another, including physical force or organized sets of laws. His view contrasts with that of Robert Audrey, who believes that human territoriality is similar to the general behavior of animals. By contrast, Sack believes that human territoriality is shown in many arrangements based on the settings (as the territorial strategy changes) and should not be compared to mere animal instinct. Human behavior is learned unlike animals where behavior is instinctive. Central to the idea of state is the concept of territoriality, making states such as the USA or Portugal examples of a territoriality. The concept of territoriality today is tied closely with the concept of sovereignty; In specific terms, a territoriality is defined by a country or community's strong defense and protection over its territory as a result of its sense of attachment to it.</description>
